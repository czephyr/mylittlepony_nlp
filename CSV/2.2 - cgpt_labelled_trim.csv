1301,Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,"Applejack, you're ready with the apples in case he decides to attack. But it shouldn't come to that, because Fluttershy will do what she needs to do to wake him up, and between the two of us, we should be able to get him to understand why he needs to go. Is everypony ready?",joy,1

2810,Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,Pinkie Pie,"That's so not true, Twilight! Sometimes it's a bunch of random things happening to my body at random times that supposedly predict the future. I call 'em ""combos"".",joy,1

3060,Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,Rainbow Dash,Aaaaaah! What do I do?! Everypony's gonna see me fail! The Wonderbolts will never let a loser like me join. Princess Celestia will probably banish me to the Everfree Forest! My life is ruined!,fear,1

3072,Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,Twilight Sparkle,"I found a spell that makes temporary wings, but it was too difficult to do more than once. So I found an easier spell that lets the rest of us walk on clouds.",joy,1

3074,Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,Rainbow Dash,"To be honest, I was starting to get just the teeniest, tiniest bit nervous. But I feel a lot better now that you guys are here. Hey, we've got some time before the competition. Why don't Fluttershy and I show you around Cloudsdale?",joy,1

9387,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Pinkie Pie,"How could I possibly not know? Clearly this dastardly deed was done by the baker, who knew their dessert could not measure up to the mastery of the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness. I guess you feared your <e9>clairs lacked flair, Gustave!",anger,2
9388,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Pinkie Pie,"Thus, destroying the cake and the Cakes' chance of winning the National Dessert Competition.",sadness,2
9389,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Twilight Sparkle,But it makes no sense!,anger,2
9390,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Pinkie Pie,"What do you mean, lowly assistant?",anger,2

9392,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Pinkie Pie,Huh... Guess that isn't a totally silly question.,surprise,2
9393,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Twilight Sparkle,"And second, the cake hasn't been sliced. It's been bitten. Just look at the teeth marks!",disgust,2
9394,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Pinkie Pie,"Hm... You're right, my fine fellow. Gustave le Grand is clearly in the clear, which means the ""MMMM"" was destroyed by another baker. A baker who's donuts are do-nots. That's right, it was Joe!",surprise,2
9395,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Pinkie Pie,"[voiceover] Or as he's known the spy world, Mane. Con Mane.",surprise,2
9396,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Pinkie Pie,Crushing the Cakes' chances to win!,anger,2

9399,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Rarity,"Although, you would look rather dapper in a tuxedo.",joy,2
9400,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Pinkie Pie,"Huh... You may be right, lowly assistant.",surprise,2

9408,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie, stop! This is ridiculous! Look at her!",anger,2
9409,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Pinkie Pie,[sigh] I guess you're right...,sadness,2
9410,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Twilight Sparkle,Thank you!,joy,2
9411,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Pinkie Pie,"But I was so sure that it was one of the other bitter bakers that destroyed the ""MMMM"". That way, their delicious dessert would reign supreme. I mean, just look at Joe's Donutopia. It's a spectacular city of donutty delight, topped temptingly in sprinklicious sprinkles. And Gustave's <e9>clairs look incredibly edible, with glistening glaziness. But then there's Mulia Mild's Mousse Moose. [sighs] why, this mouth-wateringly marvelous mousse moose tempts the taste buds with its silky, smooth, yummy-nummy, chocolateyness. So why did this criminal devour the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness while leaving this trio of tasty treats untouched?",disgust,2
9412,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Pinkie Pie,[gasp] Now I have no idea who do-doned it!,surprise,2
9413,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Pinkie Pie,This mystery gets more mysterious every minute.,surprise,2
9414,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Twilight Sparkle,"Well, you have to stop the wild accusations and get to the truth. Everypony go back to your cars while we do a little investigating. Okay, Pinkie, in order to really solve this mystery, we're going to have to find clues.

9415,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Pinkie Pie,"Huh! You're not accusing me, are you?",surprise,2
9416,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Twilight Sparkle,No! But maybe you saw something that will help us.,neutral,2
9417,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Pinkie Pie,I saw a silhouette in the moonlight!,surprise,2
9418,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Twilight Sparkle,Good... Let's retrace your steps.,neutral,2
9419,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Pinkie Pie,"And then I chased the culprit down the train towards the caboose, but when I got there, he was gone.",fear,2
9420,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Twilight Sparkle,"Hm... A-ha! Our first clue. I think I know who did it, Pinkie.",surprise,2
9421,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Pinkie Pie,Already?,surprise,2
9422,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Twilight Sparkle,"Yes, but I need more evidence to confirm. Tell me what happened next.",neutral,2
9423,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Pinkie Pie,"I heard somepony else in the dessert car and chased them up to the engine. But when I got there, all I saw was the conductor shoveling coal.",surprise,2

9425,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Pinkie Pie,Well... I went back to the dessert car.,neutral,2
9426,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Twilight Sparkle,Yes?,neutral,2

9432,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Twilight Sparkle,What next Pinkie?,neutral,2
9433,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Pinkie Pie,That's it. I was here guarding the cake the rest of the night. I mean... I slept by the cake the rest of the night.,joy,2

9443,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Pinkie Pie,"A-ha! A blue feather! I knew it was you, Gustave le Grand!",surprise,2
9444,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie, Gustave doesn't have blue feathers.",neutral,2
9445,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Pinkie Pie,"No, 'cause he's been dyeing them!",surprise,2
9446,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Twilight Sparkle,"No, Pinkie. Remember how when you chased the suspect to the caboose, they suddenly disappeared? That's because they flew away. But the thief did leave a little something behind, didn't you, Rainbow Dash?",surprise,2
9447,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Rainbow Dash,I-I don't even like cake!,disgust,2
9448,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Pinkie Pie,So Rainbow Dash did it! Case solved!,joy,2
9449,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Twilight Sparkle,"Case not solved, because when we went to the engine, I saw the conductor's hat. And inside the hat was... this.",surprise,2
9450,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Pinkie Pie,So it was you! That pink hair came from your rainbow-colored mane!,surprise,2
9451,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Rainbow Dash,"I don't have pink in my mane, Pinkie!",neutral,2
9452,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Pinkie Pie,So you're wearing a wig?,surprise,2
9453,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Rainbow Dash,Ow! Cut it out!,anger,2
9454,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie, remember? You chased a pony to the engine, where you thought you saw the conductor shoveling coal, but that wasn't the conductor at all. It was... Fluttershy!",surprise,2
9455,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Fluttershy,[gasp] Oh my.,surprise,2
9456,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Pinkie Pie,"You're goin' down, Fluttershy!",anger,2
9457,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie! But then another clue confounded my suspicions. You were guarding the cake when the curtains mysteriously closed. But that's no mystery, that's magic. But when the thief tried to make their great escape, they left a little addition to the portrait. Has anypony else noticed that Rarity is wearing her hair rather differently today?",surprise,2
9458,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Rarity,"[gasp] What? Is it a crime to change one's style now and again? Why, I think it's a crime not to.",surprise,2

9488,MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,Pinkie Pie,"Today I learned that it is not good to jump to conclusions. You have to find out all the facts before saying somepony did something. If you don't, you could end up blaming somepony for something they never did.

10681,Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,Fluttershy,She's in the Everfree Forest?!,surprise,3
10682,Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,Fluttershy,"Oh, this is me being brave! I wanna be brave at home, locked in my closet, with my teddy bear!",joy,3
10683,Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,Twilight Sparkle,I can't believe I didn't recognize the Alicorn Amulet!,surprise,3

10685,Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,Twilight Sparkle,But how am I supposed to beat that amulet? My magic's not good enough!,fear,3
10687,Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,Twilight Sparkle,"Nix your magic, use the six... Nix your magic, use the six! Use the six! That's it! Zecora, you're a genius! Now we'll need to get you back inside Ponyville, Fluttershy.",joy,3
10689,Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,Twilight Sparkle,I know about the Alicorn Amulet. I know you cheated.,anger,3
10691,Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,Twilight Sparkle,"Yeah. And I thought you might wanna see what a real magical amulet looks like. Zecora gave it to me. [muffled] It's from beyond the Everfree Forest, [normal] and it's way more powerful than your measly little Alicorn Amulet!",anger,3
10693,Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,Twilight Sparkle,[muffled] Care to put your amulet where your mouth is? [normal] How about another duel?,surprise,3
10695,Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,Twilight Sparkle,"That's up to you! But I guess you'll never see the totally awesome magic from beyond the Everfree Forest. Come on, Zecora.",joy,3

10721,Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,Twilight Sparkle,"By the way, Trixie, the amulet around your neck? It's one of Zecora's doorstops.",surprise,3
10723,Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,Twilight Sparkle,"You're right. Not even me. Zecora taught me so much about magic while I was in exile. She even taught me when not to use it. My magic alone wasn't powerful enough to take on the Alicorn Amulet head to head, so I needed to use a different kind of magic <U+0096> the magic of friendship. I also knew that the only pony who could get the amulet off your neck was you.",joy,3
10725,Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,Twilight Sparkle,That's not magic. That was just Pinkie Pie.,joy,3

11049,Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,Rainbow Dash,A hoof bump? Seriously? You made me clip my wing. You sent half of our class into serious tailspins on the obstacle course. You unleashed a tornado that nearly demolished my friends!,anger,3
11051,Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,Rainbow Dash,And I get that you want to be the best. So do I! But you're going about it in the wrong way.,anger,3

11059,Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, well that ""effective tactic"" nearly took out my friends! No disrespect, ma'am, but there's a big difference between pushing yourself as hard as you can and just being reckless. And if being reckless is what gets rewarded around here, if that's what it means to be a Wonderbolt, then I don't want any part of it.",anger,3
11061,Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,Rainbow Dash,I quit.,sadness,3

She sent me to study friendship, which is something I didn't really care much about. But now, on a day like today, I can honestly say I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for the friendships I've made with all of you. Each one of you taught me something about friendship, and for that, I will always be grateful. Today, I consider myself the luckiest pony in Equestria. Thank you, friends.

12216,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,Applejack,"Fluttershy's right. Don't know about y'all, but I've still got bushels to do to get ready. The official celebration may be here in Canterlot, but hoo-wee, has the Mayor put us in charge of one heck of a party back home. Aw, don't look like that, sugarcube. You get to be right there with the other Princesses when Celestia raises the sun.",joy,4
12217,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,"And I'm honored. Really, I am. It's just that the Summer Sun Celebration is what first brought us all together. It just doesn't feel right not getting to spend such a special day with my Ponyville friends.",sadness,4
12218,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,Rarity,"It doesn't feel right to us either, darling. If the Mayor wasn't so desperate for our assistance, we'd most certainly stay here in Canterlot. And of course we do understand that your royal duties must come first.",neutral,4
12219,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,Applejack,"The Summer Sun Celebration may have brought us together, but it's something much bigger that'll always keep us connected.

12233,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,So do I.,neutral,4
12234,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,Spike,The Celebration isn't until the day after tomorrow. We could still fit in a quick trip to Ponyville and be back in plenty of time to finish off these last few things before the main event!,joy,4
12235,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,"[sighs] That would be nice, Spike, but what if something else came up while we were gone? What if we were delayed getting back and I wasn't able to finish everything on that list? What if we lost the list on the way to Ponyville and then couldn't remember which things we'd done and which things we hadn't done, and then spent so much time trying to figure out what we hadn't done and what we had done, and we ruined the entire Celebration by not doing the one really important thing that we were supposed to do?!",fear,4
12236,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,Spike,Uh... so that's a 'no' then?,neutral,4
12237,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,These are the first royal duties Princess Celestia has given me. I can't risk letting her down!,fear,4

12357,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,Where am I?,fear,4
12359,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,Princess Luna! I don't understand. Where are we? Why did you and Celestia disappear?,fear,4
12361,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,Precious light?,joy,4
12364,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Spike,They're missing!,fear,4
12365,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,The Everfree Forest is... invading. I think I'm starting to get a pretty good idea of who we're up against.,fear,4
12366,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Discord,I'm reformed. Don't you remember? Why don't you ask your zebra friend?,anger,4
12368,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,Princess Luna!,surprise,4
12370,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,Luna! Think of how long you were banished to the moon! You'll give us no choice but to send you back there if you don't stop!,fear,4
12373,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,Celestia!,surprise,4
12374,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,No... Why would Luna do this? Why now? [crying] You're all right. You're all right! Princess Celestia?,sadness,4
12376,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,Are those the Elements of Harmony? But that's how they looked in... the past. This is the night you banished her.,surprise,4
12378,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,Why are you all looking at me like that?,fear,4
12379,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Applejack,It's just... you were mumblin' to yourself...,neutral,4
12380,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Pinkie Pie,Ooh! And don't forget the uncontrollable sobbing!,joy,4
12381,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Fluttershy,We were really worried about you.,fear,4
12382,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Discord,"I for one found it delightful. Sort of a one-pony theater piece, if you will. You should really consider taking it on the road.",joy,4
12383,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Rainbow Dash,Did you find out whose rump we need to kick and where we can find them?,anger,4
12384,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,I saw something from a long time ago. But it didn't explain what's happening now.,neutral,4

12393,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,This must be when they turned Discord into stone.,sadness,4
12394,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Discord,[laughing] You should see yourselves right now. The expressions on your face. So intense. So sure of yourselves. [laughing] Hilarious!,joy,4
12396,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,The Tree of Harmony? My cutie mark.,joy,4
12399,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Spike,So what did you find out?,neutral,4
12400,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,"I still don't know what's happened to Princess Luna and Princess Celestia, but I think I know why the Everfree Forest is acting this way. Something's happened to the Tree of Harmony.",fear,4
12401,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Rainbow Dash,The tree of what now?,surprise,4
12402,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,It's where Princess Celestia and Princess Luna found the Elements. I think it's in danger.,fear,4
12403,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Applejack,"Well, all right then! Let's go save a... tree. Uh... where is it exactly?",surprise,4
12404,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,I think it's in... there.,neutral,4
12405,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Discord,Ooh-hoo! I'm going to need more popcorn!,joy,4
12406,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Rarity,Seems like only yesterday we were heading into these woods to find the Elements of Harmony.,joy,4
12407,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,"Seems like only yesterday I was foolish enough to think I should go after them on my own. I don't know what we're going to face in there. But whatever it is, I know we need to face it together.",fear,4
12408,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Rarity,[gasps] A cragadile! Run for your lives!,fear,4
12409,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,That was close.,surprise,4
12412,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Rainbow Dash,"Aw, you'll figure it out eventually.",joy,4
12413,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,"""Eventually"" isn't soon enough.",anger,4
12414,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Applejack,"You have been having an awful lot of trouble with those things. And, well, who knows what else is gonna to come after us? You know, maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea for Twilight to go back to Ponyville and let us look for the Tree of Harmony without her.",fear,4
12415,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,What? Why?,surprise,4
12416,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Applejack,"For starters, you just about got eaten by a cragadilly.",fear,4
12417,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,We all did. He wasn't after just me.,neutral,4
12418,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Applejack,"Sure, but... well, the rest of us aren't princesses.",neutral,4
12419,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,What's that got to do with anything?,anger,4
12420,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Applejack,"Princess Celestia and Princess Luna are gone. If something happened to you, I-I just don't think Equestria can risk losing another princess.",fear,4
12421,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Rarity,"Applejack does make a valid point. Even if we manage to save the Tree of Harmony, it won't necessarily mean Princess Celestia and Princess Luna will return. Equestria will need somepony to lead in their absence.",sadness,4
12422,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,But the Tree of Harmony! I'm the only one who has seen it and knows what it looks like.,surprise,4
12423,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Rainbow Dash,"Huge tree, cutie marks on the trunk, probably being attacked by something hideously awful? Yeah, I'm pretty sure we'll know it when we see it.",surprise,4
12424,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,All of you feel this way? Feel like I shouldn't be here?,sadness,4
12425,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Fluttershy,It is probably for the best.,neutral,4

12428,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Discord,You're welcome! Hmph. No luck finding your tree?,neutral,4
12429,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,We ran into some trouble. And my friends decided it would be best if I returned to Ponyville while they continue the search. Equestria will need me if Princess Celestia and Princess Luna don't return.,fear,4
12430,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Discord,I'm just surprised that you agreed to their plan. I never thought you'd be the kind of pony who would think she was better than everypony else.,surprise,4
12431,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,I don't think I'm better than anypony!,joy,4
12433,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Spike,"Come on, Twilight. Discord may be reformed, but he's not that reformed. He's just trying to get under your skin.",anger,4
12434,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,"Well, it's working!",joy,4
12435,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Rainbow Dash,Anypony else starting to think this is a lost cause? We're almost at Celestia and Luna's old castle. Maybe whatever Twilight saw when she took that crazy potion wasn't real. Maybe there is no Tree of Harmony. Maybe<U+0096>,fear,4
12436,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Applejack,Maybe it's right down there.,neutral,4
12437,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Rainbow Dash,[gasp] It can't be!,surprise,4
12438,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Rarity,How are we supposed to get to it?,neutral,4

12442,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Spike,"We can't just give up. Maybe if I get up there, I'll be able to spot 'em. Well, what do you know? Twilight?",surprise,4
12443,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Fluttershy,[gasp] I think it's dying!,fear,4
12444,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Rainbow Dash,Nice try. Heh- Whoa! Oof!,surprise,4
12445,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Rarity,"Valiant efforts on both your parts, but the tree remains in jeopardy.",sadness,4
12446,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Applejack,And I suppose you've got a better idea? That's what I thought.,anger,4
12447,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Fluttershy,I know who would know what to do. But we sent her home.,sadness,4
12448,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Rainbow Dash,"It was your idea, Applejack!",anger,4
12449,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Applejack,"We all agreed it was the best thing, Rainbow Dash! We were tryin' to protect her.",joy,4

12453,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Rainbow Dash,Up here!,surprise,4
12454,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Pinkie Pie,Yoo-hoo! Come and get me!,joy,4
12455,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Rarity,Don't forget about me!,joy,4
12456,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Pinkie Pie,Ta-da!,surprise,4
12457,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Applejack,I sure am glad you came looking for us.,joy,4
12458,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,Not as glad as I am that you found me.,joy,4
12459,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Rarity,"The truth of it is, Twilight, we're simply lost without you.",joy,4
12460,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Rainbow Dash,Yeah. Equestria may need its princess...,joy,4
12461,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Fluttershy,... But we need our friend.,sadness,4
12463,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,I know how we can save the tree. We have to give it the Elements of Harmony.,joy,4
12464,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Rainbow Dash,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, heh. How are we supposed to protect Equestria?",surprise,4
12465,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Rarity,How are we meant to rein Discord in if we can't use the Elements to turn him back to stone?,fear,4
12466,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Applejack,Twilight... The Elements of Harmony... They're what keep us connected no matter what.,joy,4
12467,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,"You're right about one thing, Applejack. The Elements of Harmony did bring us together. But it isn't the Elements that will keep us connected. It's our friendship. And it's more important and more powerful than any magic. My new role in Equestria may mean I have to take on new responsibilities, and our friendships may be tested, but it will never, ever be broken. There's no time to lose. Everypony ready?",joy,4

12473,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Discord,"Bravo, ladies, bravo! How ever did you save the day this time? Blast the beastie with your magic necklaces, I presume? Where are those little trinkets of yours? You know, the ones you use to send me back to my extremely uncomfortable stone prison?",anger,4

12480,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,What did you say?!,anger,4
12481,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Discord,"Oh, why should I try to explain it when you can see for yourself?",neutral,4
12483,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Discord,"Oh, I doubt that. [munching] Hungry? [voice over] Well, obviously things didn't go according to my original plan. My plunderseeds should have stolen the magic from the Tree of Harmony and captured Princess Celestia and Princess Luna thousands of moons ago. Alas, it seems the tree had enough magic to keep the seeds from growing up big and strong. Until now, that is.",disgust,4
12484,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,You realize this is information we could have used hours ago?!,anger,4
12485,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,Discord,And rob you of a valuable lesson about being princess? What kind of friend do you think I am?,anger,4
12487,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Spike,"What's wrong, Twilight?",neutral,4

12495,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Applejack,Uh-uh. There is no way I'm movin'.,fear,4

12508,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Applejack,Right. I think I might have an idea of what we can do.,neutral,4
12509,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Fluttershy,"Um, Rarity? Don't you think it's a little late in the day to be walking through the forest? It is... star-spider season, after all. Though, I'm sure you have a very good reason.",fear,4
12510,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Rarity,Simply the most important reason I've ever had in my entire life!,joy,4
12511,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Fluttershy,"Oh, well then I'm happy to help. What is it?",joy,4
12512,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Rarity,"I've heard rumors that the Castle of the Two Sisters is filled with the most gorgeous of ancient tapestries in all of pony history! It pains me to think of those magnificent creations rotting away in those old ruins, totally unappreciated.",sadness,4
12513,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Fluttershy,I see...,neutral,4
12514,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Rarity,I require your help in borrowing one or two to bring back to the boutique where I can restore them. Maybe I'll even use the patterns as the inspiration for a new line!,joy,4
12515,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Fluttershy,That does sound... very important.,neutral,4
12516,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Fluttershy,"Um, are you sure you need those tapestries?",neutral,4
12517,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Rarity,"But, of course. Although, I must admit these ruins are a fright. Just look at all the dirt everywhere! Ugh...",fear,4
12518,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Fluttershy,[gasp] Angel!,surprise,4
12519,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Fluttershy,"Angel! Oh, you really shouldn't have run off like that. Ancient ruins are filled with all sorts of things that can hurt you! You could stub your toe, or, or trip on a loose stone... You have to be careful!",fear,4
12520,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Spike,"I don't think I'll need all these candles, Twilight. I was really only scared for a second.",fear,4
12521,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, these aren't for you, Spike. We're gonna be studying late into the night, and we're gonna need all the light we can get.",joy,4

12523,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Applejack,"Well, here we are!",joy,4
12524,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Rainbow Dash,"Uh, what's so daring about this place? This is where we got the Elements of Harmony.",joy,4
12525,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Applejack,"When I was just a filly, Granny Smith told me of an ancient legend. When Nightmare Moon was banished, not every last bit of her dark magic went with her. Granny used to say, when night falls on the castle, that magic takes the form of... the Pony of Shadows!",surprise,4

12544,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Rarity,I suppose these ruins are chock full of them.,neutral,4

12550,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Applejack,"Well, m-me neither!",fear,4

12552,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Applejack,Deal.,neutral,4
12553,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Rainbow Dash,But it's gonna take a lot more than some shadowy ghost pony to get me to leave.,joy,4

12560,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Rainbow Dash,"I sure hope you're not afraid of the dark, Applejack!",fear,4
12561,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Applejack,"I can't say that I am! But even if I was, I'd be at least fifty percent less scared of it than you, Rainbow Dash.",fear,4

12566,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Applejack,Yeah. Nothin'... creepy about that.,disgust,4
12567,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Rarity,I'm starting to wonder if maybe this castle doesn't want my expertise!,fear,4

12569,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Rarity,"I'm not sure he made the trip down with us, dear.",neutral,4
12570,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Fluttershy,"Oh, goodness! We have to find him. An ancient castle is no place for a bunny. He could get hit by falling debris, or the floor could give out under him! Oh! He could be trapped in a dark place with no way out!",fear,4
12571,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Rarity,[flatly] I can only imagine how that might feel. Hmm...,neutral,4

12588,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, Spike. Quit being such a scaredy-dragon. This castle is thousands of years old, and half of it was destroyed by Nightmare Moon. Of course it makes strange sounds. It's practically falling apart!",neutral,4

12598,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Rainbow Dash,Whoa! [nervous laughter] It's just old pony armor. What's the big deal?,surprise,4
12599,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Applejack,Yeah! It's not like it's gonna come to life or anything. Right?,surprise,4
12600,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Applejack,Huh?!,surprise,4
12601,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Applejack,Whoa-oa!,surprise,4
12602,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Rarity,"[groans, spits] Now, you look here, castle! You are very old and very scary! But your wall art is in an atrocious state!",anger,4
12603,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Rarity,And there is nothing you can do to keep me from my sacred task of restoration!,joy,4
12604,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Rainbow Dash,"Uh... Applejack? If you went back to Ponyville, that means I win, right?",neutral,4

12642,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Pinkie Pie,"Oh, yeah! I only had to ring it for, like, five minutes! They said that was good enough! Eh, can't imagine why...",joy,4
12643,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Pinkie Pie,"So then, I decided to throw a ""finish ringing the school bell"" party! But I didn't have any bluebells, and you can't throw a ""finish ringing the school bell"" party without bluebells, so I went to Everfree Forest to pick some, but it started to get so chilly.",joy,4
12644,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Pinkie Pie,"I had to wrap myself up in the tarp I was gonna use to gather flowers, and then I saw Fluttershy and Rarity. But they went into the castle before I could invite them to my party. Luckily, I followed them inside so I could help you all with your party!",joy,4
12645,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Rarity,What party is that?,neutral,4
12646,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Pinkie Pie,Duh!,disgust,4

12652,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Rarity,"You certainly did that, Twilight.",joy,4
12653,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Rainbow Dash,Yeah! Why weren't you scared?,fear,4
12654,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"Reading Celestia's diary made it hard to be afraid, because I knew what it was like when she and Luna lived here. Knowing something about the past made it easier to deal with my problems in the present, even the scary ones.",joy,4
12655,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"I've just thought of a great idea! Why don't we keep a journal, just like the royal pony sisters?",joy,4
12656,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Fluttershy,All of us?,neutral,4
12657,Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"Sure! That way we can learn from each other! And maybe some day, other ponies will read it and learn something, too!",joy,4

12668,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Fluttershy,"Yeah... So, um, why am I excited?",surprise,4
12669,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Rainbow Dash,"Because the next Daring Do book is coming out exactly four months from today! That's how exciting it is! So what amazing, incredible, awesome adventure do you think Daring Do will have in her next book, huh?",joy,4
12670,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Rainbow Dash,"[voice over] Will she at long last stalk the Fortress of Talacon? Only to be forced to contend with its dreaded and impenetrable arrow defense? And if so, could her skill, quick wits, and courage possibly carry the day? Or will her next adventure bring her face to face with the vast and horrible Ahuizotl himself?!",surprise,4
12671,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Rainbow Dash,"Would she cower, turn tail and run? Or would she fly at him, full bore, knowing full well against all odds that the greatest challenge she ever faced was still surely no match for<U+0097>",fear,4

12680,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Rainbow Dash,How come nopony bothered to invite me?,sadness,4
12681,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Applejack,"I came to invite you personally, but it seems you were a speck too busy reading the last Daring Do book for the twelfth time.",disgust,4

12684,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Rainbow Dash,[spit-take] Two more months?! I've been waiting so long already! I don't think I can take another two months! I'll never make it!,sadness,4
12685,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Fluttershy,Yeah. I can vouch for that...,neutral,4
12686,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Rainbow Dash,Did they give a reason?,neutral,4
12687,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,The publisher just said author A.K. Yearling won't be able to finish the book for another two months. Cupcakes?,disgust,4
12688,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Rainbow Dash,[growls] How could you possibly know that before me? I'm the series' biggest fan!,anger,4
12689,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,"I'm just as big a fan as you! In fact, I'm the one who first introduced you to the books, remember?",joy,4
12690,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Rainbow Dash,Oh. Right.,neutral,4
12691,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,"A.K. Yearling just might be my favorite author. I know everything about her. Where she grew up, where she studied literature, where she wrote the first Daring Do book...",joy,4

12693,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,"Uh... no, though I could probably find out somehow. Why?",neutral,4
12694,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Rainbow Dash,"Don't you get it? The new book is obviously delayed because she needs help dealing with whatever everyday nonsense is distracting her from spending her every living breathing second writing! So I<U+0096> I mean, fans like me, can get to read the new book ASAP! Think about it! We could help her with her laundry, buy her groceries, cooking her meals, whatever! Now, who wouldn't appreciate that?",anger,4
12695,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,"Hmm, I don't know... What she probably wants most of all is respect for her privacy.",neutral,4
12696,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Rainbow Dash,She can always just say no.,neutral,4
12697,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,Mmh... I suppose you're right...,neutral,4
12698,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Rainbow Dash,Of course I am. So... how's about getting that address?,neutral,4
12699,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,You see what I mean? Why would she live in this remote part of Equestria except to keep folks from intruding on her privacy? We should respec<U+0097>,neutral,4
12700,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Rainbow Dash,I think I spotted the house! We're super close! This way!,joy,4
12701,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,Wait! Oh no. What happened?,fear,4
12702,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Rainbow Dash,Apparently somepony has intruded on her privacy pretty hard already...,anger,4
12703,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Applejack,"Hoo-wee, somepony really trashed this place.",surprise,4
12704,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Pinkie Pie,"Hmm... Maybe... or maybe A.K. Yearling's just a terrible, horrible, unbelievable slob!",anger,4
12705,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Rarity,I hope A.K. Yearling's alright!,joy,4
12706,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,Oh no! What if something terrible happened to her?,fear,4
12707,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Rainbow Dash,"I know! There might be no more books! Uh... But, of course, I'd be worried about her, too. Heh.",fear,4
12709,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,We didn't do this! We swear!,surprise,4

12712,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,We're awfully glad to see you're alright.,joy,4
12714,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Rainbow Dash,Great! Maybe now would be a good time for me to ask her how we can help move the new book along a little faster. Chop chop!,joy,4
12715,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,"Rainbow Dash, a minute please! A.K. Yearling has made it pretty clear that she wants to be left alone. We need to respect her wishes!",neutral,4
12716,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Pinkie Pie,You should tell that to those guys.,neutral,4

12740,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,You heard her! She says she works alone!,anger,4
12741,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Rainbow Dash,How can we just stand by and do nothing? You know what's at stake here! Ahuizotl has sought control of the Tenochtitlan Basin since book three!,anger,4
12742,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,"True, but in book four, she defeated Ahuizotl and secured control of the Amulet of Atonement, dispelling the dark magic of the Ketztwctl Empress, and thus protecting the basin with the Radiant Shield of Razdon!",joy,4

12744,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,"But are you forgetting that the Rings were scattered to the four corners of Tenochtitlan, thus rendering the dark enchantment powerless?",surprise,4
12745,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Rainbow Dash,"Only if you assume that the Rings have yet to be retrieved, and the ring Caballeron just stole isn't the last to completely restore the dark tower and its cruel hold on Tenochtitlan! Did you ever think of that?!",anger,4
12746,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Pinkie Pie,"You gotta admit, Rainbow Dash makes a pretty good point.",joy,4
12747,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Rainbow Dash,We gotta help Daring Do retrieve the ring for safekeeping before it's too late!,joy,4
12748,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,"[sighs] Okay, but sounds to me like we're in way, way, way over our heads. We're going to need a carefully thought out plan...",fear,4

To join an adventure with the greatest, bravest, coolest, most incredible hero I could ever<U+0096> [whimpers] Okay, maybe I just need a sec... Just another adventure. No big deal. [smack] Get a grip! I got this. Though, doing it alongside Daring Do... Wow! Maybe I could get my picture taken with her, or an autograph<U+0096> [smack] There you go again. She's just a pony like any other pony. A pony who stops entire armies of bad guys with nothing more than her bare hooves, and an attitude, and<U+0097>! [smack] Ow... That's starting to hurt.",fear,4
12752,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Rainbow Dash,Yow! Stop!,fear,4

12756,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Rainbow Dash,But why won't you let me team up with you just this once?!,anger,4
12758,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Rainbow Dash,"But just because you can't trust some, doesn't mean nopony can be trusted!",joy,4
12760,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Rainbow Dash,Neither do I. Let's go!,joy,4
12762,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Rainbow Dash,Looks like they decided to have an early dinner before making their way back down the hill to the marketplace in town.,joy,4
12763,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Rainbow Dash,"Oh, I see. You're gonna ambush them like in book four at the Horavian caves! Or maybe, that neat trick you did in book three, where you swoop in and knock three guys down with one swing! Or maybe- [hushed] Okay. I'll be quiet now. Just watching very quietly, heh. Shh. So, what kind of ambush are you gonna use then?",joy,4
12764,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Rainbow Dash,Wow!,surprise,4

12782,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,"Dash, I'm sure whatever you did was an honest mistake.",joy,4
12783,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Rainbow Dash,Whatever. Let's just go home.,neutral,4
12784,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Applejack,We can't go back now! Looks a mite like she needs our help more than ever!,surprise,4
12786,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,"Look, there is more going on here than meets the eye. In every Daring Do book, there always is! We can't turn our backs on her!",joy,4
12787,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Rainbow Dash,"She doesn't want my help, Twilight.",sadness,4
12788,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,Perhaps. But she might need it anyway.,neutral,4

12793,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Rainbow Dash,She's here where she's got no business being. She should be at home.,anger,4
12794,Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,"It's fine to look up to Daring Do, but you've put her so high up on a pedestal, you can't even see your own worth anymore! She's in the fortress, and we're here, and we wouldn't be who we are if we didn't go in after her! And neither would you! So, are you with us, or not?",anger,4

13153,Bats!,Merriwether Williams,Applejack,"Uh-huh. And in the meantime, this pest and his vermin friends are gonna go after my prized apple and, while they're at it, every other apple in the orchard! These vampire bats are nothin' but a bunch of monsters!",anger,4

13173,Bats!,Merriwether Williams,Applejack,[whinny] Have you lost your pest-lovin' mind?!,anger,4
13174,Bats!,Merriwether Williams,Fluttershy,"They're only here because they're hungry! If we build a sanctuary for them, they could have their own apples to enjoy! After a while, they could even help the rest of your orchard! The vampire bats don't eat the seeds of the apples, and when they spit them out, they grow into even more productive apple trees!",joy,4
13175,Bats!,Merriwether Williams,Applejack,"Listen, Fluttershy. That sounds real nice 'n' all, but every second we spend buildin' this so-called 'sanctuary' is a second they'll spend destroyin' orchards! You don't know what it was like the last time there was an infestation, but Granny Smith has told me enough stories about it that just the thought of it gives me nightmares! [narrating] Granny says we lost a huge section of orchard that year. They had to ration out apples all winter!",fear,4
13176,Bats!,Merriwether Williams,Rainbow Dash,"What about the cider? There was still cider, right?",joy,4
13177,Bats!,Merriwether Williams,Applejack,Not...a...drop.,fear,4

13180,Bats!,Merriwether Williams,Twilight Sparkle,"I'm sorry, Fluttershy, but I think Applejack is right. I just wish there was another way we could convince them not to eat them in the first place. Maybe there is...!",joy,4
13181,Bats!,Merriwether Williams,Twilight Sparkle,"So, there's good news and bad news. The good news is that I found a spell that can get the vampire fruit bats to stop wanting to suck the juice from the apples. But in order for the spell to work, I need the bats' full and complete attention.",joy,4
13182,Bats!,Merriwether Williams,Fluttershy,[gasps] Oh no.,fear,4

13189,Bats!,Merriwether Williams,Fluttershy,I'm sorry. I just don't like the idea of taking away the thing that really makes the vampire fruit bats [inhales] vampire fruit bats! It just feels wrong!,sadness,4
13190,Bats!,Merriwether Williams,Twilight Sparkle,"But if we don't do this, there won't be any apples left for anypony here in Ponyville. Doesn't that feel wrong, too?",fear,4
13191,Bats!,Merriwether Williams,Applejack,"So what's it gonna be, Fluttershy? Will you do your Stare on the bats or not?",surprise,4

13250,Bats!,Merriwether Williams,Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, so this is me, these are the bats, and this is Fluttershy doing her Stare. The spell was supposed to go right onto the bats like this, but somehow the spell must have backfired.

13655,Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,Applejack,Twilight agreed this was definitely an experience worth puttin' in the journal. Think I'll write about how bein' a good family isn't about bein' perfect as much as it is about bein' able to get through the rough patches together. About bein' able to forgive each other for mistakes.,joy,4
13656,Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,Apple Bloom,Don't forget to mention how really good friends can also feel like your family.,joy,4

13715,Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,Twilight Sparkle,Some ponies do what?,neutral,4
13716,Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,Rainbow Dash,[sighs] Have a better chance of qualifying and going to the Equestria Games than others.,joy,4

13759,Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,Twilight Sparkle,It just seems like one of the teams you're practicing with needs a little more help than the other one.,neutral,4
13760,Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,Rainbow Dash,"But it's so much more fun working out with the winners than... um... the non-winners. Besides, Ponyville will still qualify.",joy,4

13769,Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,Rainbow Dash,"Well, I...",neutral,4
13771,Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,Rainbow Dash,They want me to fly with them! It's like a dream come true!,joy,4
13772,Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,Twilight Sparkle,"If you fly for Cloudsdale, Pinkie Pie won't have anypony to cheer for. Rarity's uniforms will never be seen. And Applejack will have slaved over those apple brown bettys for nothing.",sadness,4
13773,Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,Rainbow Dash,"Oh, but I really wanna fly with the best team! What would you do?",joy,4

13788,Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,Rainbow Dash,[with mouth full] Thank you. I couldn't have done that on my own.,joy,4
13789,Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,Rarity,Nothing says 'get better' like a little medical pizazz! Silk slings and a glitter bandage?,joy,4
13790,Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,Rainbow Dash,That might help.,neutral,4

13813,Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,Rainbow Dash,"I-I feel great, because... I was never hurt in the first place.",joy,4
13814,Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,Rainbow Dash,"I faked my injury so that I wouldn't have to choose between flying for Ponyville or Cloudsdale. I wanted to fly with you both, and the decision was too hard!",joy,4
13815,Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,Fluttershy,"Oh, Rainbow Dash, you don't have to choose us. I know you love to win, and you should go with the team that surely will.",joy,4
13816,Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,Rainbow Dash,I know now who I should've been loyal to.,sadness,4

14344,Simple Ways,Josh Haber,Applejack,Because you would never dress like that. You like fashion and high society and fancy things.,disgust,4

14354,Simple Ways,Josh Haber,Rarity,"[country accent throughout] Now, to be a model in the Simple Ways fashion show, you might think ""simple"" means ""less is more"". Well, that just ain't so. If you want to be real simple, more is more. Now, y'all go off and make yourselves look just like that. [to Spike] Who's our next model for the fashion show?",joy,4
14355,Simple Ways,Josh Haber,Spike,Um... Apple... Jewel?,neutral,4

14389,Simple Ways,Josh Haber,Rarity,"I think what Applejack is trying to say is that there's something unappealing about a pony who'd change themselves so much just to impress somepony else. If somepony doesn't like you for who you are, it's their loss.",joy,4

14394,Simple Ways,Josh Haber,Rarity,"Organizing the Ponyville Day celebration was one of the hardest things I've ever done. But I learned an important lesson. Real friends will like you for who you are, and changing yourself to impress them is no way to make new ones. And when you're as fabulous as I am, it's practically a crime!",joy,4

Everypony staring at you, judging you, jealously noting how they could be way better than you! Why wasn't it them? Why wasn't it them? And then, when you choke, they'll turn on you, becoming a seething, angry mob, and you'll be horribly humiliated, never able to show your face in Ponyville again!",fear,4

14421,Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,Fluttershy,I have... stage fright.,fear,4
14422,Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,Pinkie Pie,[gasps] Is it contagious?!,fear,4
14423,Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,Twilight Sparkle,"Stage fright isn't a disease, Pinkie. It just means that Fluttershy is scared to perform in front of everypony.",fear,4

14624,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Apple Bloom,Only I'm afraid I'll never get the hang of this potion-makin'.,fear,4
14625,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,Did you follow the magic plant-growing formula I gave you?,neutral,4
14626,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Apple Bloom,Well... uh... more or less.,neutral,4

14638,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Scootaloo,"She's using somepony else to build herself up, and without even putting any effort to learn her own skills like we do!",anger,4
14639,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Sweetie Belle,"Hey, come to think of it, if we get really good at the stuff Twilight's teaching us, we could be the big shots around here for a change! Hmm...",joy,4

14666,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Sweetie Belle,Would you two excuse us for a moment? We should totally say yes! This is a golden opportunity!,joy,4
14667,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Apple Bloom,Are you kiddin'? I don't want them laughing at us while I'm mixin' potions and accidentally sendin' plants into chokin' fits!,fear,4
14668,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Sweetie Belle,But don't you get it? They'll have to learn something too!,surprise,4
14669,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Scootaloo,And they won't be able to laugh at us when they're so busy trying to learn stuff of their own.,joy,4
14670,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Apple Bloom,I must admit it's kinda fun to see them workin' hard to get on our good side for a change.,joy,4

14686,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Sweetie Belle,Shouldn't they go first?,anger,4
14687,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,"No, silly! I set up Twilight Time especially for you. Apple Bloom, go ahead. Let's see how your plant potions are coming.",joy,4

14703,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Apple Bloom,What a mess.,disgust,4
14704,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Sweetie Belle,Of awesome! Don't you see? We're really and truly and certifiably the biggest of the big shots in school right now!,joy,4
14705,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Scootaloo,Huh?,surprise,4
14706,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Sweetie Belle,"They all think we're the greatest, because we're their ticket to get time with Ponyville's newest and biggest celebrity, Princess Twilight!",joy,4
14707,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Apple Bloom,We just said like two seconds ago that invitin' two ponies to Twilight Time was a big mistake! And now we're supposed to bring the whole class?,anger,4
14708,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Sweetie Belle,Relax. I got this.,joy,4
14709,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Apple Bloom,"I don't like this, Sweetie Belle...",disgust,4
14710,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Sweetie Belle,You said not to invite them to Twilight Time and I didn't. So what's the problem?,anger,4
14711,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Scootaloo,This feels like a trick.,surprise,4
14712,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Sweetie Belle,What's tricky about inviting Twilight out for a meal thanking her for all the nice things she's done for us? Seems like the least we can do for the princess!,joy,4
14714,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Sweetie Belle,"When I told you when you could come eyeball the princess at one of her favorite hangouts, I said only two or three of you, tops!",anger,4
14716,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Scootaloo,She's coming!,joy,4
14717,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Sweetie Belle,Okay! But stay out of sight!,fear,4

14721,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Sweetie Belle,You are?,neutral,4
14722,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,"When you first asked me to help you develop new skills, I thought, 'Working with young students so devoted to the joy of learning purely for its own sake? What could be better?' You all remind me of myself when I was your age!",joy,4
14723,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Sweetie Belle,"Yes, well... we feel the same way.",neutral,4
14724,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Apple Bloom,That's why we invited you here.,neutral,4

14732,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Sweetie Belle,"Oh, we're gonna look sad all right...",sadness,4
14733,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,"[gasps] [long pause] Uh, can I... help you?",surprise,4
14737,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Sweetie Belle,This is bad.,sadness,4

14739,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Apple Bloom,I told ya this was a terrible idea.,fear,4
14740,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,"You seriously all want my autograph? Okay, I'll sign just a couple more for you, but then I really must get back to my little friends. Oh, there you are!",joy,4
14742,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,This isn't my regular hangout. I'm only here to be with them.,neutral,4

14773,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Scootaloo,We didn't mean for so many other ponies to be here! Honest!,surprise,4
14774,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, don't be silly. I only meant that for your benefit so you could get the most out of our time together. But if you want to share your time with others, that's fine.",neutral,4
14775,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Scootaloo,So you're not mad?,neutral,4
14776,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,"Of course not! Come on in, everypony! Spike made nachos!",joy,4
14777,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,Turns out we'll need some more than that.,neutral,4
14778,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,"Before we start, we should maybe get a bit more organized? Ponies interested in magic in this corner. Ponies who want to learn potions over here. Bookworm ponies over there.",neutral,4
14779,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Apple Bloom,Incredible. Looks like everything's workin' out just fine.,joy,4
14780,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Scootaloo,And I was so afraid Twilight would be disappointed in us.,fear,4
14781,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Sweetie Belle,Told you I knew exactly how to handle all this!,joy,4
14782,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,Thanks to all of you for taking time out to come learn new things.,joy,4
14785,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, okay, let's settle down. If you want to thank anypony, thank the Cutie Mark Crusaders for so generously sharing this time.",joy,4
14786,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Sweetie Belle,"It was nothing, really. We just felt it was the right thing to do.",joy,4
14788,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,"Let's begin over here. And what would you like to learn, little one?",joy,4

14793,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,Is this true?,neutral,4
14794,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Sweetie Belle,We wanted our time together just as a way to be with you and learn new things. Really and truly!,joy,4

14801,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Sweetie Belle,"No, wait! Hey, everypony, you're in luck! You came to learn, but instead you're getting dinner and a show! Get ready, 'cause we, the Cutie Mark Crusaders, are about to lay on you the amazing skills we learned in Twilight Time!",joy,4
14802,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Sweetie Belle,"Unfortunately, since we don't have Scootaloo's unicycle parts, she'll take apart and put back together one of the scooters from outside.",neutral,4
14804,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Scootaloo,"You got us into this mess, kid. Might wanna roll with us.",anger,4
14806,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Sweetie Belle,"Apple Bloom doesn't have her apple seed with her, so she'll just grab an apple from the kitchen. And I will begin by using my magic to lift this broom!",joy,4

14808,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Apple Bloom,Become a tree!,neutral,4

14820,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Apple Bloom,Thanks...,joy,4
14821,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Sweetie Belle,Thanks...,joy,4

14823,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Spike,"[straining] Aw, come on!",anger,4
14824,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Sweetie Belle,"I guess Twilight must not be so super-upset anymore, 'cause she's letting us do a diary entry like our sisters do. Boy, did we get our priorities messed up. We started acting special because we were friends with someone special. We almost forgot the real reason she's special <U+0096> because she's our friend. But she forgave us, and, like magic, things are good as new! That's the kind of magic I really want to get good at, now that I'm getting so good at the other kind.",joy,4
14825,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,"Wow, all three of you have made so much progress! I'm really proud of you. See you next time!",joy,4
14826,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Sweetie Belle,We're just glad Twilight Time is back to normal. Well... almost back to normal. I just hope no one sees us.,fear,4
14827,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Apple Bloom,'Cause we're tryin' to keep Twilight Time a secret now?,anger,4
14828,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Scootaloo,Or because we look ridiculous?,sadness,4
14829,Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,Sweetie Belle,"A little of both, actually.",neutral,4

14833,It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,Fluttershy,"And that breeze is very important, but so is cheering on those teeny-tiny little things, so they have the confidence to ride that breeze to their native land. Did I mention how tiny they are? So tiny! I was thinking we could do a special Breezie cheer!",joy,4
14834,It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,Pinkie Pie,I love cheers!,joy,4
14835,It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,Fluttershy,"But these cheers should be quiet cheers. We don't want to startle them. They need to be able to concentrate. Why don't we try it? You can do it, Breezies.",joy,4

14838,It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,Applejack,"Heh, sorry, Fluttershy. I had no idea how hard it was to do a cheer quietly.",joy,4

14846,It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,Rainbow Dash,That's too strong! We gotta slow this breeze down or we're gonna blow those Breezies apart!,fear,4
14848,It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,Fluttershy,"Well, you see, it's the breeze that activates the Breezies' magic, and that magic protects the pollen they're carrying from being destroyed.",joy,4
14850,It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,Fluttershy,That's right! And they only have two days to get that pollen back before the portal to their home closes. That's why it's ever-so-important that we help them make their way through Ponyville safely.,joy,4
14852,It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,Fluttershy,Now you understand.,neutral,4
14854,It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,Fluttershy,"Oh, thank you. I went to see them gathering their pollen in Western Equestria. Um, Rarity? I, uh, hate to weigh in with you when it comes to fashion, but...",neutral,4

14857,It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,Fluttershy,"Oh, no-no-no-no-no. It's the perfect amount of purple. It's just that there's an awful lot of sequins on your jacket.",disgust,4
14858,It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,Fluttershy,"You can if they reflect the sun, and the light catches a group of Breezies right in their eyes, and blinds them long enough to get them off their course so they never get home!",anger,4
14859,It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,Rarity,I stand corrected! I suppose there is the rare instance where one can have too many sequins. I'll just take off my jacket. I suppose this won't do either?,surprise,4
14860,It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,Twilight Sparkle,"[whispering] Everypony, it's time. Please welcome... the Breezies!",joy,4
14861,It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,Applejack,They're as cute as Apple Bloom on the day she was born.,joy,4
14862,It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,Rarity,And would you look at those adorable little packs they carry their pollen in?,joy,4

14878,It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,Fluttershy,And you speak my language too?,surprise,4
14880,It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,Pinkie Pie,That was amazing!,joy,4
14881,It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,Rainbow Dash,I'm sorry we couldn't get a breeze going that would get them back to the others.,sadness,4

14890,It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,Fluttershy,Maybe we should wait just a moment or so. They've been through so much...,sadness,4

Well, my Breezies, I think we can all agree that now that you've eaten and you have a little energy going in your breezy bodies, you're strong enough to face the breeze!

15290,Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,Fluttershy,Pinkie Pie was in trouble! Maud would move mountains for her if she had to.,joy,4
15291,Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,Twilight Sparkle,That's it! I think I finally realized what we all have in common with Maud! Something that just might be worthy of a very important super-duper special tradition that only the closest and bestest of friends can share!,joy,4

15597,Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,Apple Bloom,So you're just gonna walk up and ask them how it works?,surprise,4

15608,Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,Applejack,Hey! Huh?,surprise,4
15611,Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,Applejack,"You two charlatans sold my Granny a bottle of tonic, and now she's off actin' like a filly again.",anger,4
15613,Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,Applejack,"If she keeps gallavantin' around like a yearlin', she's apt to drop from exhaustion or worse! What's more, I know for a fact that your friend here is dressin' up as a different pony every night so he can pretend to be cured!",fear,4

15646,Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,Apple Bloom,Oh. Okay.,neutral,4
15647,Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,Applejack,"I don't know, Granny. A swim meet sounds pretty safe. And after all, if that tonic lets you swim in a river and a swimmin' hole, a pool should be no problem at all.",neutral,4
15654,Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,Applejack,It seems to work for Granny.,joy,4
15658,Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,Applejack,"Just remember, you two. The most important thing is to be safe and have fun, right?",joy,4
15660,Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,Applejack,"Uh... good luck, then!",joy,4

15690,Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,Applejack,"I didn't mean to! But everypony seemed so much happier, I couldn't bring myself to tell you when I found out the tonic wasn't real. I know it was wrong. I just hope with time, I can win back everypony's trust.",sadness,4
15691,Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,Apple Bloom,"But if the tonic is a fake, then how come Granny can swim again, and what about all that aquabatics stuff we just did?",surprise,4
15692,Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,Applejack,"I reckon sometimes you can forget what you're capable of, and it just takes a little extra confidence to remember that it was inside of you all along. But tellin' ponies your tonic can do things it can't is just wrong!",anger,4
15696,Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,Applejack,"Believin' in somethin' can help you do amazin' things. But if that belief is based on a lie, eventually it's gonna lead to real trouble.",sadness,4

15905,"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,Rainbow Dash,"[sighs] Nothing important. Except after Luna was banished to the moon, Celestia needed protective forces, so Earth, unicorn, and Pegasi formed the E.U.P. Guard of the Protective Pony Platoons.",neutral,4

15941,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Twilight Sparkle,"Please, it's not that big of a deal. There always has to be a princess at the Exchange. Last year was Princess Cadance, this year it's me. It's just a formality. I'm sure none of the other ponies will even notice I'm here.",joy,4

15949,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Applejack,I guess a pony who's here on official princess business has to expect a little fussin'.,joy,4
15950,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Rainbow Dash,"There's a pony here who's got a signed first edition of Daring Do and the Quest for the Sapphire Statue, and I'm gonna get it! I've been able to get first editions of all of the Daring Do books, except this one! Nopony's ever put together a whole set, and I'm gonna be the first! If it hasn't been traded yet... It's the only one in all of Equestria!",joy,4
15951,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Fluttershy,"Oh no! I'd really hate to see you disappointed. I did want to trade this bear call I've got for a bird whistle, but getting that book seems so important to you, so if you need me to help you first...",neutral,4

15962,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Twilight Sparkle,"I may be the princess on duty, but I don't think that means I have to sit up there all alone doing nothing.

15981,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Rarity,But... that's a dented old pie tin.,surprise,4
15982,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Applejack,A dented vintage pie tin. The metal they used to fashion this one helps cook the pies up to five seconds faster! They don't make 'em like this anymore!,joy,4
15983,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Rarity,"I'm so glad you showed that to me, darling...",joy,4
15984,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Rarity,"...because once you see what I've found, you won't want to waste our trade goods on that. [giggles] Just look at this gorgeous vintage brooch. It's one of a kind!",joy,4
15985,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Applejack,It looks exactly like the one you're already wearin'.,neutral,4
15986,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Rarity,"Well, yes, they may look the same, but I know it's older, and that's what makes it so much more divine!",joy,4
15987,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Applejack,"But that doesn't make a lick of sense! Why, I'd wager if I switched them up, you wouldn't even know the difference!",anger,4
15988,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Rarity,"Oh, don't be silly, of course I would!",joy,4
15989,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Applejack,So which is the vintage one?,neutral,4

15992,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Rarity,Am I? How can you tell?,neutral,4
15993,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Applejack,"Well... because... [groans] I can't, 'cause the one you wanna waste our whole stash on is exactly the same as the one you already got! There's no way anypony would notice the difference!",anger,4
15994,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Rarity,I'd say it's a lot more likely they'd notice that than some dented tin that cooked a pie a whole two seconds faster!,neutral,4
15995,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Applejack,It's five seconds faster!,joy,4
15996,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Fluttershy,"Yes, such a good two-headed boy. Yes, you are!",joy,4
15998,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Rainbow Dash,"Okay, I can see you're busy, so I'll give it to you straight. I need to trade this horseshoe for... that.",neutral,4

16026,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Pinkie Pie,"Nope, I just came to pony-watch! I'm not going anywhere. I won't let you make a mistake like that again! Hey, everypony, step right up! Do not walk! Gallop over here for your chance to trade for authentic, one-of-a-kind, official princess merchandise!",joy,4
16027,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Rainbow Dash,"Well, that took forever.",neutral,4
16028,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Fluttershy,I just hope it looks okay.,fear,4
16030,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Rainbow Dash,"Oh no! The pony we're supposed to trade the chicken statue to didn't tell us what kind he wanted! Okay, look. I'm fast. I'll fly over to the lamp stand and find out what kind of chicken he wants. Just don't let anypony trade for any chicken while I'm gone, okay?",fear,4
16031,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Fluttershy,"Um, well, okay! Um, I can do that, I think. [to Crusoe Palm] Um, well, maybe you shouldn't get one of those? You know... unless you really want to...",neutral,4

16039,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Twilight Sparkle,Hey!,joy,4
16040,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Pinkie Pie,"Then she read these books, and voila! Princess! So who wants to start the bidding?",joy,4
16041,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, just a moment, please! Pinkie, I appreciate your help and all, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this. Nopony should trade for my books just because I'm a princess. I'm not better than anypony else!",sadness,4

16073,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Rainbow Dash,Hey! You said you wanted an Orthros!,joy,4
16075,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Fluttershy,"There, there, that's a good Orthros. You just have to know how to train them. With a little patient training and a big slobber mop, they can be a wonderful household pet.",joy,4
16077,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Rainbow Dash,Yes!,joy,4
16079,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Fluttershy,"Gosh, training an Orthros takes a long time. I'll probably be gone from Ponyville for... I don't even know how many moons! But... if that is what you really want...",sadness,4

16084,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Pinkie Pie,"Oh, come on! These are the books the princess would sit up with all night, with nothing to read by but the light of her own horn! Ooh, now that looks fun<U+0096> but not fun enough! These are the books that made Twilight the princess she is! So who's got what it takes to trade for them?",disgust,4
16086,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, yes, they are.",joy,4
16087,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Pinkie Pie,But I thought you wanted to get rid of them!,surprise,4
16088,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Twilight Sparkle,"None of those ponies had anything valuable enough to trade for my books. Not because these books belong to a princess, but because they helped make me who I am. Just like you said. This was the one I was so absorbed in the day Spike decided he owed Applejack a life debt. And this one reminds me of the day I got it <U+0096> which was the day I met you. I may not ever need to read these again, but that doesn't mean they don't have value. I realize that now, thanks to you, Pinkie.",joy,4
16089,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Pinkie Pie,I told you I'd take care of everything!,joy,4
16090,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Rainbow Dash,Twilight! I need you to say a trade wasn't fair! Fast!,fear,4

16092,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, I said it, but I was wrong! I did want that book, a lot. I said I wanted it more than anything in all of Equestria. But there's no thing that's worth as much to me as a friend. I might have forgotten that for a little bit, but it's true. Which means there's no way this trade can be fair!",joy,4
16094,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Pinkie Pie,[in distance] Woo-hoo!,joy,4
16095,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Rarity,"I know it's not the pie tin you were after, but I hope you like it. It's the rustiest piece of junk I could get.",neutral,4

16097,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Rarity,Ohhh!,surprise,4
16098,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Applejack,"And I know you're gonna love it, 'cause you already have a bunch of ones that look exactly the same sittin' in the drawer doin' nothin'. So that should settle it once and for all which of us is the better friend.",joy,4
16099,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Rainbow Dash,"Oh, come on! You both gave up what you wanted to get something for each other! That's the coolest thing a friend can do. Trust me, I know.",joy,4
16100,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Pinkie Pie,"Hey, where's your double-doggie?",neutral,4
16101,Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,Rainbow Dash,I traded it for something way better.,joy,4

16382,Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,Spike,"Okay, fine. I'll come. Can I at least wear these?",neutral,4
16383,Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,Rainbow Dash,Those aren't your average arrows. They freeze whatever part of the target they hit. Whoever encases their entire target in ice first wins. Keep your eye on number seven from Cloudsdale <U+0096> he's the favorite.,neutral,4
16384,Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,"Honestly, Spike, I don't see why you're being so hard on yourself.",joy,4

16386,Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,Twilight Sparkle,"Are you kidding? I've totally let ponies down. That's not the point. The torch got lit, the aerial relay teams got their medals -- no harm, no foul.",neutral,4
16387,Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,Spike,Can we at least watch from inside there? I'm not sure I'm ready to face crowds in the stands just yet.,fear,4

16407,Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,Applejack,"How does it feel to have opened the best Equestria Games in Ponyville history, squirt?",joy,4
16408,Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,Apple Bloom,Probably as good as it feels to close them!,joy,4
16410,Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,Spike,"You know, it's kinda weird. No matter how many times others tell you you're great, all the praise in the world means nothing if you don't feel it inside. [inhales] [breathes fire] Sometimes to feel good about yourself, you gotta let go of the past. That way, when the time comes to let your greatness fly, you'll be able to light up the whole sky.",joy,4
16411,Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,Spike,"Seems like only yesterday I was saving this place from being totally destroyed. Hey, you guys remember that?",joy,4

16421,Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,I've just been feeling a little unsure about things lately. It doesn't seem that my new role as a princess equates to all that much.,sadness,4
16422,Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,Applejack,That's just silly. You've got a real important role in Equestria.,joy,4
16423,Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,Fluttershy,Princess Celestia wouldn't have asked you to come today if she didn't think so.,joy,4

16433,Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,I guess I just don't really understand why I'm here. Couldn't one of the royal guard have unfurled the banner?,sadness,4
16436,Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,And I'm happy to see you. All of you.,joy,4
16438,Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,Twilight Sparkle,"But I... well, it's just that Princess Luna raises the moon, Princess Celestia raises the sun, you protect the Crystal Empire, and all I seem to do is... smile and wave.",sadness,4

16489,Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,Discord,"You're right, Spike. It is a big deal. Seems I possess a magic that gives me quite an important role in Equestria. Maybe they should make me an Alicorn princess.",joy,4

17948,The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,Twilight Sparkle,"So, maybe Gilda was a little rude. You still get to go to Griffonstone, and according to this book, it has a rich, fascinating history! [narrating] In ancient times, griffons were known to be as greedy as dragons, always hoarding their bits and other treasures. But all that changed when King Grover found the mysterious golden Idol of Boreas. Legend says the Idol of Boreas was made from the dust of golden sunsets, blown across the mountains by the north winds. Possessing the Idol of Boreas filled the griffons' hearts with pride. It's said that that one great treasure is responsible for turning Griffonstone into the most majestic kingdom of all the land.",joy,5

You two can handle whatever the issue is just fine. I'll stay here and do important princessy things. I guess.",disgust,5

Once in Griffonstone proper, go immediately to the palace and introduce yourself to the king. ""Bygone Griffons of Greatness"" was written a long time ago, and it ends with the coronation of the fourteenth king of the griffons, King Guto. I have no idea who's in charge now. Tell the king you've been sent by the Princess of Friendship, and you're there to help with some sort of problem. If for some reason the king can't help, I'd try the Griffonstone library next. It's a little known secret that if you befriend a librarian, you can usually find out anything. Plus, as a bonus, there's a statue of King Grover outside! [giggles] Photo op!

You showed up to a party and everypony was extremely disappointed in you. Can you imagine anything more upsetting?",fear,5

20263,Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,Twilight Sparkle,How did you do all this?!,surprise,5
20264,Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,Fluttershy,"After you left, I realized that I wasn't ready to give up on Nightmare Night. So I asked Granny Smith if I could try to make the maze even scarier for my friends.",joy,5
20265,Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,Rainbow Dash,You came up with all of this?,surprise,5
20266,Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,Fluttershy,"I had some help. Angel was the scary figure that kept scurrying after you in the maze. Fuzzy Legs made the sticky wall that made it difficult for you to see and move. And, of course, Harry was the especially scary monster.",fear,5
20267,Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,Twilight Sparkle,Wow! That was inspired!,joy,5
20268,Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,Pinkie Pie,You have to do this every year!,anger,5

20276,Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,Fluttershy,"Yes, but I've also realized something. You all may love Nightmare Night and I may be good at being a part of it, but it's no fun for me to see my friends feel like they're in danger, even if I know they're not. I really don't like it. It's just not my cup of tea.",sadness,5
20277,Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,Pinkie Pie,Spoooooooooky tea?,surprise,5
20278,Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,Fluttershy,"No. Just regular tea. We do lots of fun things together, but I'm afraid this just isn't gonna be one of them. Actually, I'm not afraid. I'm perfectly fine with it.",fear,5

20284,What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,Twilight Sparkle,I've even devised a better system for organizing them. It decreases the amount of time it takes to find a book you're looking for by nearly three quarters of a second!,joy,5
20285,What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,Spike,[flatly] Whoa. That much?,surprise,5
20286,What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,Twilight Sparkle,"Look at them all. Why, there must be at least twenty thousand books to organize!",surprise,5

Mm-hmm. Did I get the tiniest bit of glee out of watching her try to recreate our weekend of fun in the name of science? Oh, most definitely! But what's important here is that it was never my intent to make Twilight feel jealous. That's something that the old me would have tried to do. Orange you glad I've changed?",joy,5

When they found the valley between the Smokey Mountains, they knew it was something special. So they made a promise to each other to protect and preserve the valley for all its adorable furry inhabitants. But they disagreed on how to go about it. Grub wanted to start by planting crops so that everypony would have something to eat. But Piles thought it would be better to start by building a shelter to protect them against the cold and wind. The two ponies were unable to come to an understanding, so Piles went ahead and built a shelter anyway, exactly where Grub was gonna start his farm! Grub was upset, so he tore down Piles' shelter so he could plant his crops!",anger,5

20696,The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,Applejack,"...then we lost touch. But Rara always did want to go to Manehattan to try and make it big. But a demandin' diva? Just you wait, Pinkie. Once Rara gets here, you'll see she's just a plain old pony like you and me.",joy,5
20697,The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,Pinkie Pie,I don't have to wait <U+0096> she's here!,joy,5

20723,The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,Applejack,She's become a whole other pony!,joy,5

20732,The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,Applejack,Rarity was right! I don't believe it!,surprise,5
20735,The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,Applejack,"Correct me if I'm wrong here, but that feller isn't actually complimentin' Rara. He's complimentin' all the bells and whistles he's piled on to make her Countess Coloratura.",neutral,5
20736,The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,Rarity,"Oh, no-no-no-no-no, you don't understand, Applejack. Creating all those elements is a lot of work, and Countess Coloratura's performance wouldn't exist without them.",joy,5
20737,The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,Applejack,"If you ask me, that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing.",neutral,5
20739,The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,Pinkie Pie,"Actually, right now you're scheduled for your meet and greet with the schoolponies!",joy,5

20761,The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,Applejack,"Well, while you were meetin' with the schoolponies, he was demandin' all sorts of stuff from Pinkie Pie.",anger,5
20763,The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,Applejack,"Well, do you see somethin' wrong with him tellin' Pinkie that if she doesn't get those things by tomorrow, he'd pull you from our charity festival?",anger,5
20765,The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,Applejack,I'm afraid Svengallop doesn't give a pickled pippin about your charity work.,fear,5
20767,The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,Applejack,"Jealous of what? A pony who hides behind a veil so thick she can't see when somepony's usin' her? No, I'm not jealous of that, Rara!",anger,5

20804,The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,Applejack,"Now, now, don't go gettin' yourself into a tizzy there, Rara. Svengallop turned you into Countess Coloratura and acted like your friend so he could enjoy the perks that came with bein' a star. But the real perk of friendship is gettin' to see your friend bein' true to their self. And Rara, when you're simply yourself, you're the brightest star I've ever seen shine.",joy,5

20825,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"Exactly. Let's go through it one more time. [clears throat] When Princess Celestia asked me to speak to you today, I was honored to have the opportunity to talk about my favorite subject: magic.",joy,5

20830,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"I can speak from my own experience that the power of Cutie Mark Magic is very real, and in the instance of my friends and I, it can be traced to a single event! Without Rainbow Dash's race to defend Fluttershy's honor, this rainboom wouldn't have happened. Fluttershy might never have discovered her love of animals. Applejack might never have realized that she belonged on her farm. And Pinkie Pie might never have decided to leave hers. It might be hard to imagine Rarity without her sense of fabulousness. But it's even harder to fathom what my life would be like. Without this rainboom, I might not have gotten into magic school. Celestia wouldn't have taken me on as her pupil or sent me to Ponyville to meet my friends. And the most powerful thing about Cutie Mark Magic that I found is the connection I share with them.",joy,5

20832,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,The real question about... Cutie Mark Magic is... who it seems to affect.,neutral,5

20836,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,Forcing everypony in her village to have the same cutie mark wasn't right. We had to do something!,anger,5
20837,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Spike,"And now she's coming back for revenge. Uh, or she was just really interested in your speech!",surprise,5
20838,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"Honestly, Spike. I'm not really sure what I saw. But as long as I have my friends, I know everything will be all right.",joy,5
20839,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,Maybe I was just more stressed about that speech than I thought.,fear,5
20840,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Spike,Yeah. That sounds better than Starlight Glimmer coming back with an evil plot for revenge.,joy,5
20841,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"Well, when you say it like that, it does sound kinda silly.",neutral,5
20842,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Spike,Or it's totally true!,joy,5

20852,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,Did Rainbow Dash look really young to you? And I didn't see a cutie mark. You don't think...,fear,5

20874,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"Starlight altered Star Swirl's spell, then somehow used it on the map to travel into the past and change something! Once she did, the map pulled us back to the present!",surprise,5

20906,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Applejack,But I still don't see what this has to do with you and I bein' friends.,neutral,5
20907,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"Another pony named Starlight Glimmer used this map to travel through time and change things in the past. For some reason, the map's here but everything else is different!",surprise,5
20908,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Applejack,Different how?,neutral,5
20909,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"Well, for one thing, where we came from, there's no war with King Sombra. Maybe you could tell us how the war started, then we can figure out when everything changed!",joy,5
20910,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Applejack,"That's easy enough. [sighs] When the Crystal Empire returned, it brought King Sombra back with it.",sadness,5
20911,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Applejack,[voiceover] And it didn't take long for him to force every one of his subjects to fight for him against Equestria.,anger,5
20912,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Applejack,"[voiceover] And even with Princess Celestia leadin' the charge, it still takes every last pony in Equestria doin' their part, workin' day and night, to keep up the fight.",joy,5
20913,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,I just can't believe it! We stopped King Sombra! You and me and all of our friends!,joy,5

20919,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Spike,So... how are we gonna set things right?,neutral,5
20920,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,I don't know! The only thing we know for sure is that Starlight stopped the rainboom.,surprise,5
20921,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Spike,And that the map's still here.,neutral,5
20922,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"[gasps] Spike, that's it! The map is connected to the Tree of Harmony! It must sense that something isn't right! That's why it's still here! I'll just use Starlight's version of the spell and go back a little earlier and stop her before she even knows we're there!",surprise,5
20923,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,All we have to do now is find Starlight and<U+0097>,neutral,5
20924,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,"Well, finding her will be easy! But stopping her's gonna be harder than you think. Sorry to disappoint you, but I created that spell to send myself back in time. So even when you cast it, I still get sent back here. It wasn't difficult to change Star Swirl's spell. He'd already done the hard part. But figuring out I could use the map to go to any time or place and pull you along with me? [short laugh] I even impressed myself with that. I knew you'd try to stop me. You're so predictable. Why else would I leave the scroll behind? Touching it triggered the map to whisk you here and watch me erase the one thing that linked you with your friends! My village was a sanctuary of equality, where nopony's cutie mark allowed them to feel superior! It was a special place, and you and your friends took it away!",anger,5
20925,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,"Now it's my turn to take something special from you! Without the rainboom, you and your friends will never form your special cutie mark bonds! Cutie marks for cutie marks! Sounds like a fair trade to me!",anger,5
20926,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Spike,Twiliiiiiiight!,joy,5

20931,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Spike,Right!,neutral,5

20944,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,I mean... you were?,neutral,5
20945,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,"Of course! In a world where everypony is unique, some are bound to feel more special than others. But that isn't a license to be cruel, is it?",sadness,5

20947,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,"Oh, isn't it a shame we don't live in a world where everypony is equal? No one would ever tease anyone there! Wouldn't that be nice?",sadness,5

20952,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,I know you only convinced those bullies to not tease Fluttershy to stop the rainboom!,anger,5
20953,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,"Oh, that's not true. I convinced them not to be bullies because everypony should be equal. Stopping the rainboom is just a bonus.",joy,5

20967,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, listen. You don't have to race me. I just need you to fly fast enough for a sonic rainboom!",joy,5

21118,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,Pinkie Pie,That Starlight must be pretty magical!,joy,5
21119,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"She obviously has more talent for magic than almost anypony I've seen. My magic couldn't stop her. I had to convince her to stop on her own. Once I realized that, everything fell into place.",joy,5
21120,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,Applejack,"But if she's as powerful as all that, we can't just send her on her way, can we?",fear,5

21122,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,"[gulps, exhales] I know there's no excuse for what I did, but I want you all to know that I'm ready for whatever punishment you think is fair.",sadness,5
21123,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"I've been thinking a lot about how badly Equestria fared without just one group of friends. Because even when one friendship dies, the results can be disastrous.",sadness,5
21124,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,I know first-hoof how true that can be.,neutral,5
21125,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"And that's why I've asked you here. If you're willing to learn, I'm willing to teach you what I know. You'll have the power to make Equestria an even better place.",joy,5
21126,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,[hushed] How do I start?,neutral,5
21127,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,Starting is easy! All you have to do is make a friend! And you've got seven of them right here.,joy,5
21128,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,I never thought that I would find a place To step right in and start again I never thought that I could just begin Right where I left off and make a friend,joy,5
21129,The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"Don't ever think that it might be too late You don't have to wait, there's no mistakes with the friends you make A friendship's only made of what you bring And if you do it right, you can do anything",joy,5

21137,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,Whoops!,surprise,6
21138,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,"Sorry, Spike! I guess I'm still trying to find my way around. You don't happen to know where the library is, do you?",neutral,6
21139,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Spike,[muffled] Next door on the left!,neutral,6
21140,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,Oh. Thanks!,neutral,6
21141,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"Acceptance, mm-hmm. Altruism, definitely. Starlight, good morning, come in!",joy,6
21142,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,Sorry I'm late. I got a little turned around. I still can't believe you're letting me stay here... as your pupil... after everything I did.,surprise,6
21143,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"Well, I'm not one to dwell on the past, and neither should you. The castle is your home now, and as far as being my pupil goes, I was just trying to figure out what your first friendship lesson should be!",joy,6
21144,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,"Oh, well, it looks like you're really narrowing it down!",joy,6
21145,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, these are just the A's. After this, I move on to the B's!",joy,6
21147,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,Maybe I should pare things down a bit before we go through them. Why don't you join the others in the throne room? They're planning our trip to the Crystal Empire when Shining Armor and Princess Cadance have their baby!,joy,6
21148,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Rainbow Dash,"Well, I think we should leave ASAP. I don't want to miss the Crystalling!",joy,6

21151,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,What's a Crystalling?,neutral,6
21152,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Rarity,"Well, that's just it, darling. Princess Cadance and Shining Armor's baby is due any day, and we're still not sure. The Crystal Empire was gone for a thousand years. A lot of their customs are a bit murky.",joy,6
21153,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Applejack,We know it's got somethin' to do with the new baby.,neutral,6
21154,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Pinkie Pie,[quickly] And a party!,joy,6
21155,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Fluttershy,And the Crystal Heart.,surprise,6
21156,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Pinkie Pie,[quickly] And a party!,joy,6
21157,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Rainbow Dash,And some kinda cool energy.,joy,6
21158,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Pinkie Pie,And... a party!,joy,6
21159,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Spike,"It's not hard to understand. Most things in the Crystal Empire aren't. Like how I'm a big hero there, for example!",joy,6
21160,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Spike,"Eh... plus, I've had to help Twilight do a lot of research on Crystallings. Whenever a baby is born in the Crystal Empire, the parents bring it before the Crystal Heart. They get the purest shard of crystal they can find, then pick a crystaller to present the baby to everypony who comes. Then they all share the light and joy they feel, feeding it into the crystal that joins with the Heart, and increases its power! And this is going to be a royal Crystalling, so pretty much the whole empire will show up. That hasn't happened in a millennia!",joy,6
21161,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,What do you mean it increases the Crystal Heart's power?,surprise,6
21162,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Spike,"The energy it uses to protect the Crystal Empire, I guess.",neutral,6
21163,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,Protect it from what?,fear,6
21164,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Spike,I... didn't help Twilight with that part.,sadness,6
21165,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,"Hey, Twilight, can I ask you something about the Crystal Empire?",neutral,6
21166,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"Huh! Funny you should mention it. Because I just narrowed your first friendship lesson down to three options, and one of them is in the Crystal Empire!",surprise,6
21167,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,Really?,surprise,6
21168,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,I found out that's where the first pony you ever cared about lives!,joy,6
21169,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,Sunburst?,surprise,6
21170,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"Of course, that's just one idea. We could also go to Griffonstone. [begins fading out] Making friends with a griffon is a challenge all by itself! Or we could tag along with the CMC's the next time they try to help a pony figure out why they're special...",joy,6
21171,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,[normal] Starlight? Is something wrong?,neutral,6
21172,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,"What? O-Oh, no, heh, those all sound great!",surprise,6
21173,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,I know! I guess you were right <U+0096> it is gonna be hard to choose one!,joy,6
21174,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,[laughs nervously] ...Yeah.,joy,6
21176,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Spike,"Gee, Starlight, what's wrong?",neutral,6
21177,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,"I don't know, Spike. Twilight's figuring out what my first friendship lesson is, and I guess I'm not exactly thrilled with the options. Well... with one of them.",sadness,6
21178,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Spike,Which one?,neutral,6
21179,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,Reuniting me with my first friend.,joy,6
21180,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Spike,What's so terrible about that?,neutral,6
21181,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,"[sighs] [narrating] When we were foals, Sunburst knew everything there was to know about magic. He always knew just what to do. And he was always there to help me. I guess it's not surprising that Sunburst got his cutie mark in magic and... went off to Princess Celestia's school. But when he left...",sadness,6
21182,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Spike,"You blamed cutie marks and stripped a whole village of theirs, and when Twilight and the others stopped you, you went back in time and almost destroyed Equestria.",anger,6
21183,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,"Not really stuff I'm super eager to tell Sunburst about. I mean, he's probably some big important wizard now, and... I can't even find my way around Twilight's castle.",sadness,6
21184,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Spike,"Well, if Sunburst is that good at magic, maybe he'd appreciate your, uh... [clears throat] exploits. You should talk to Twilight about it. I'm sure she'd want to hear what you have to say.",neutral,6
21185,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,I know. But I don't want her to think I'm not ready to learn or that I'm not grateful for everything she's doing.,fear,6
21186,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,Spike! Come quick!,surprise,6
21187,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Spike,It's a Crystalling invitation!,joy,6
21188,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"Shining Armor's a father! I'm an aunt! Well, this settles it! Since we're going to the Crystal Empire, your first friendship lesson is going to be... reuniting with Sunburst!",joy,6
21189,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,Great...,joy,6
21190,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Rainbow Dash,"[yawn] Um, Applejack, what is that?",surprise,6
21191,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Applejack,"Oh, just a little somethin' for the young'un. Made from genuine Sweet Apple Acres apple trees. We make 'em for all the Apples, and anypony related to Twilight is practically family.",joy,6
21192,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, it's okay... But it's no Cloudsdale mobile! Bam!",surprise,6
21194,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Pinkie Pie,Pretty!,joy,6
21195,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Applejack,"Well, a mobile is real nice... as long as you have somethin' to lay in so you can look at it.",joy,6
21196,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Rarity,And a fetching blanket to keep you warm.,joy,6
21197,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,I'm sure Shining Armor and Princess Cadance will love all our gifts. But I think they're more happy we'll be attending the baby's Crystalling.,joy,6
21198,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Pinkie Pie,Ooh! I can't wait to see all that light and love make the Crystal Heart even more sparkly and shiny!,joy,6
21199,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"Actually, Pinkie, the Crystal Heart is an ancient and powerful relic. Without its magic, the Crystal Empire would be lost to the Frozen North.",joy,6
21200,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,"Wow, this Crystalling sounds pretty important. I'd understand if you wanted to... you know... wait to do a different friendship lesson when we get back.",surprise,6
21201,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"Are you kidding? This trip is perfect! Not only do I get to see the baby and take part in the ceremony that helps maintain the magic of the Crystal Empire, but I'm starting my new pupil off with the most amazing friendship lesson ever! I can't wait!",joy,6
21202,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,"Right... Me neither... [beat] Actually, Twilight, I am a little worried about meeting Sunburst.",fear,6
21203,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, trust me. I know what it's like to see old friends. But I'll be right there to help things along. I've broken the whole lesson down into a few easy steps to ensure this reunion goes off without a hitch!",joy,6

21211,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, of course! I don't know what I was thinking! You two probably need all kinds of help! I'm sorry, Starlight, but I guess combining your first lesson with this visit wasn't such a good idea.",sadness,6
21212,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,"Oh, uh, don't be ridiculous! You're an aunt now! That's way more important than some friendship lesson.",joy,6
21213,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,I just wish there was a way to do both.,neutral,6
21214,The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,Spike,Maybe there is! You've already done the work for Starlight's lesson with this list. All we have to do is follow it!,joy,6

22415,A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,Spike,And why would you deny yourself presents and candy? That's crazy talk!,joy,6
22416,A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,Twilight Sparkle,I think what Spike means to say is Hearth's Warming is about more than presents and candy. It's a time to spend with friends and family when we celebrate a very important day in Equestria's history.,joy,6
22417,A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,Starlight Glimmer,"I think to most ponies, it's just an excuse for silly songs and fun, not a day to remember some old story.",sadness,6

22432,A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,Rainbow Dash,"Dangerous?! It's awesome! It's the day we remember how unicorns, Pegasi, and Earth ponies came together in friendship to defeat the windigos!",joy,6
22433,A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,Starlight Glimmer,"That silly legend is the problem! Telling everypony that ""singing songs and being nice"" will solve anything? I've spent years studying magic, and that's not how it works.",anger,6
22434,A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,Rainbow Dash,I think you might be missing the point.,neutral,6
22435,A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,Starlight Glimmer,"Work hard, learn, and use your skills to better Equestria. That's a worthy goal for any pony. [sarcastically] But, by all means, if you want to go home early, ignore all of the work you have, and spend the rest<U+0097>",anger,6

22449,A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,Starlight Glimmer,Wait a minute. Snowfall doesn't like Hearth's Warming Eve so she decides to cast a spell to get rid of it altogether? That seems a little extreme.,surprise,6
22450,A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,Twilight Sparkle,"I think what Spike is trying to say is that everypony has their reasons for doing things. Even Snowfall. And if I could continue the story, we might just find out what they are.",joy,6

22452,A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,Twilight Sparkle,Snowfall was all set to cast her spell that would erase Hearth's Warming Eve for all time...,fear,6

24207,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,"Whoa! Oof! Ugh! Well, I was practicin' my distance buckin'.",surprise,6
24208,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,"Uh, distance bucking? What for?",surprise,6
24209,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,Because Cousin Braeburn and the rest of the Apple family in Appleloosa seem to think that their team can beat Ponyville at buckball.,neutral,6
24210,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,"What?! Ha! That's ridiculous! Nopony beats Ponyville! I mean, I could beat the whole town of Appleloosa at buckball with one wing tied behind my back!",joy,6
24211,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,So I can count on ya to join the Ponyville buckball team?,joy,6
24212,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,"Oh, yeah! I am so there! I've just got one question.",joy,6
24213,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,Hmm?,surprise,6
24214,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,Uh... what's buckball?,neutral,6
24215,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,"So, basically, buckball is the coolest game ever. Offense, defense, teamwork, nonstop action! It's got it all!",joy,6
24216,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,"Wow, Rainbow Dash. You sure seem to know a lot about this game. I've never even heard of... buckball.",joy,6
24217,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, I'm kind of an expert.",neutral,6
24218,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,Hmph. An expert who hadn't heard of the game either until I told you.,anger,6
24219,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,"Well, it's a new game. I probably know more than most ponies, so that makes me an expert.",joy,6
24220,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,"I don't know anything about it at all. But it sounds like there's a ball and bucking, so I'm betting it's super duper fun!",joy,6
24221,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,"The point is, my cousin Braeburn somehow convinced a Pegasus and a unicorn to come play with him on the Appleloosa team, and he can't stop braggin' about how his team is gonna beat ours!",joy,6
24222,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,"But, um, we don't have a team.",neutral,6
24223,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,"Well, between Applejack and me, we've got two-thirds of a team. All we need is a unicorn. That's where you two come in.",joy,6
24224,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,"[whispering loudly to Fluttershy] Uh... they know we're not unicorns, right?",surprise,6
24225,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,"Uh, obviously. You're gonna be on my team, and Fluttershy is gonna be on Applejack's team.",joy,6
24226,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,We'll play against each other along with whatever unicorns want to try out until we find the best one.,joy,6
24227,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,Ohhhh! Phew! That's a relief because I left my unicorn costume at home!,joy,6
24228,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,"I know a lot of you are here because I told you what an amazin' game buckball is. And even though it's already an Apple family favorite, most o' you probably don't know anything about it. So I thought we'd give you a quick demonstration. The two Earth ponies are on offense. They meet in the middle of the field for the buckoff. They both try to be the first one to kick it.",joy,6
24229,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,"And the Pegasus is on defense. She tries to keep the ball from going in the goal and passes it back to the Earth pony on her team. Just give it a little kick, Pinkie.",joy,6
24230,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,Yaah!,surprise,6
24231,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,Aah!,surprise,6
24232,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,Ohhh. I get it.,surprise,6
24233,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,And all the unicorns have to do is float these here baskets around the outside of the field and catch as many balls as possible for their team. [to Pinkie and Fluttershy] You two get the idea?,joy,6
24234,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,Absolutely!,joy,6
24235,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,"Oh, I don't know. That ball moves pretty fast.",neutral,6
24236,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,All right. Now let's see which of you has what it takes.,neutral,6
24238,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,"When the ball comes towards you, catch it.",neutral,6
24239,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,"Okay, just try your best, Pinkie. I have been doin' this a lot longer than you.",neutral,6
24240,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,[grunts] Aah!,surprise,6
24241,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,[dazzled] Nice kick.,joy,6

24243,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,"Coming your way, Pinkie!",joy,6
24244,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,Somersault kick!,surprise,6
24245,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,"Hey, this game is easy!",joy,6
24246,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,Ooh! [giggles] It actually is kinda fun!,joy,6
24247,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,Where did Pinkie Pie learn to buck like that?,joy,6
24248,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,And Fluttershy's spinning tail catch is pretty amazing.,joy,6
24249,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,"Um... okay. Well, let's see what the rest of you can do.",neutral,6
24250,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,"Now, don't expect to be able to beat me twice in a row.",anger,6
24251,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,"Well, hello there, Mr. Ball. Whee!",joy,6
24252,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,Hiya!,joy,6
24253,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,"Hurry along, butterflies, before that ball comes and hits you.",fear,6

24256,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,Nope.,neutral,6

24265,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,It sure didn't.,neutral,6
24266,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,This game is a whole lot more fun than I thought it would be.,joy,6
24267,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,It's exactly as much fun as I thought it would be! A whole bunch!,joy,6
24269,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,Snails! Look out!,fear,6
24271,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,Amazing!,joy,6
24273,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,"Hey, Snails, can you float one of those baskets over here?",neutral,6
24275,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,Catch!,surprise,6
24277,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,"Wow, Snails. You're a natural at buckball.",joy,6
24278,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,"It's a good thing, too. We were running out of unicorns.",joy,6
24279,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,Do you think you'll be ready to play with Applejack and Rainbow Dash against the Appleloosa team?,joy,6
24281,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,"Well, Snails, with you on the team, Ponyville is one step closer to crushing Appleloosa!",joy,6
24282,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,"Huh. And after today, it's pretty clear who the other two players should be.",surprise,6
24283,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,W-What do you mean? I thought you and Dash were gonna play.,fear,6
24284,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,"Yeah! If you're not crushing Appleloosa, who is?",joy,6
24285,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,"[laughs] Uh, you two, obviously!",joy,6
24286,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,"Um, you want us to play buckball against Appleloosa instead of you?",surprise,6
24287,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,Mm-hmm.,neutral,6
24288,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,"That's ""uncredible""!",disgust,6
24289,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,Unbelievable and incredible? [scoffs] Come on!,disgust,6
24290,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,"I can't explain it, but you two are really good at this game. And if it means beatin' Appleloosa, I'll give either one of you my spot on the team quicker than Granny Smith can core an apple.",joy,6
24291,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,"Me, too. I'd normally be so pumped all of Ponyville was counting on me to win, I'd run right over the competition. But you still flew rings around me.",sadness,6
24292,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,"Oh, I'm sorry. I was just having fun.",neutral,6
24293,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,"Well, you can have all the fun you want as long as it's while you're beatin' the hide off of Braeburn's team.",joy,6
24294,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,I do like fun!,joy,6
24295,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,"Honestly, the game was a little scary at first, but once I got the hang of it, I had a pretty good time.",fear,6
24296,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,Let's get this party started!,joy,6
24297,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,"All right. But if we really wanna beat Appleloosa, we're gonna have to get serious.",neutral,6

24303,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,"That's why, before we leave for Appleloosa tomorrow, you two are gonna practice just as hard as we would.",joy,6
24304,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,So let's hop to it! Snails already has a head start on you!,joy,6
24305,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,"Okay, if you wanna win, you totally gotta get this drill down!",joy,6
24306,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,I-I-I do?,surprise,6
24307,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,It's all about ball control.,joy,6
24308,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,[gasps] Whoa!,surprise,6
24309,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,"Ready? Go! Come on! Faster! You don't want Ponyville to lose because you can't get into high gear, do you?!",joy,6
24310,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,[gasps] Whoa! Ugh!,surprise,6
24311,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,All right. Bein' able to buck a ball into a goal from any direction is the most important thing in the game.,joy,6
24312,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,"Eh, if you say so.",neutral,6
24313,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,Whee! Woo-hoo!,joy,6

24329,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,"All right! That's it for today, y'all!",joy,6
24331,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,I thought practice was supposed to make us better.,sadness,6
24332,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,Maybe we just need a little rest.,neutral,6
24333,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,Or a whole lot of it.,neutral,6
24334,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,Just be sure to get your heads in the game before tomorrow. All of Ponyville is countin' on a win.,joy,6
24335,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,"I really don't want to let Applejack and Rainbow Dash down, or anypony else, but after that practice, I'm not feeling very confident.",fear,6
24336,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,Maybe we weren't that bad!,joy,6
24337,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,I guess I was hoping you saw something I didn't.,neutral,6
24338,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,"I know our friends want us to win, but how can the whole town be counting on us if most ponies have never even heard of buckball?",fear,6
24339,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,I know! How can we disappoint a pony who doesn't even know we have a team?,surprise,6
24340,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,Or that we're gonna play Appleloosa?,joy,6
24341,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,Pfft. Yeah. I don't think we need to worry. I'd be surprised if anypony in this town cares about this game at all.,surprise,6
24344,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,Heh. We kinda went around town and talked up the team a little.,joy,6
24345,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,Yup! We wanted to make sure you two knew that all of Ponyville was behind you!,joy,6
24346,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,[nervous] Greaaaaat...,fear,6
24347,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,I hear the whole town's already plannin' a parade for when you get back after whuppin' Appleloosa! That should feel pretty good!,joy,6
24348,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,[nervous] It should...?,fear,6
24349,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,"Totally! Just spend the whole ride to Appleloosa thinking about everypony cheering for the victorious Ponyville buckball team! [gasps] I bet Princess Celestia even comes to congratulate you! If that doesn't get you in ""the zone"", I don't know what will!",joy,6
24350,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,"I don't know what zone Rainbow Dash is talking about, but I'm pretty sure I don't want to be in it. Do you?",fear,6
24351,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,Hey! You two are supposed to be in the zone!,anger,6
24352,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,[squeaks] You see... the thing is... thinking about everypony... thinking about us...! Aah! There's just no way to...!,fear,6
24353,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,"There's no way that we can get in the zone, because the zone sounds like a horrible place since we are terrible at buckball and we are going to lose and let everypony down and we don't want to play anymore!",fear,6
24355,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,I don't get it. They're naturals! Why wouldn't they want to play anymore?,sadness,6
24356,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,Maybe us telling them how much everypony was countin' on them messed them up somehow.,sadness,6
24357,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,What?! That's crazy talk! Having ponies depend on you is exactly what you need to focus! And<U+0097>,surprise,6
24358,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,Get serious and play hard and<U+0097>,neutral,6
24359,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,"Get ready to totally smash the competition, and<U+0097> and... none of that sounds like Pinkie or Fluttershy, does it?",surprise,6
24360,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,"[sighs] Guess not. We got so wrapped up in what's important to us, we went and ruined what was fun about the game for them.",sadness,6
24361,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,[groans] What do we do now?,sadness,6
24362,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,Pinkie? Fluttershy?,joy,6
24363,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,We know you're in here! We've looked in every other car on the train!,fear,6
24364,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,[muffled] Maybe you need to look again!,neutral,6
24365,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,[muffled] Yeah! Because... we're totally not in here!,surprise,6
24366,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,[muffled] And we're definitely not in here if you're gonna try and make us play against Appleloosa!,anger,6
24367,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,Or anypony else!,joy,6
24368,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,Oh... we're sorry to let you down. But it's better to do it now than during the game against Appleloosa.,neutral,6
24369,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,You don't have to play against Appleloosa.,neutral,6
24370,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,We don't?,neutral,6
24371,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,Nope. We're gonna take your place. So you don't have to worry about that at all.,fear,6
24372,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,[sighs] Why didn't you say so?,neutral,6
24373,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,But... we can't take on Braeburn and his team without any practice. So we need you to play just one more time.,neutral,6
24374,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,Against us.,anger,6
24375,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,"Now I know we mixed up the teams before, but since Dash and I really need the practice, we'll play against the two of you.",joy,6
24376,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,"Oh, I don't know how much practice you'll get against us. We've been playing just awful.",sadness,6
24377,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,Don't worry about it. Applejack and I just need a little workout.,joy,6
24378,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,Yup. You two just do your best.,joy,6
24379,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,I can do that!,joy,6

24385,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,Yeah! I could do this all day!,joy,6
24386,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,"[panting] No, thanks. Playing against you two is just as humiliating now as it was when we weren't trying to show you how awesome you are.",sadness,6
24387,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,Wait... what?,surprise,6
24389,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,You must've noticed how you aren't bad anymore.,joy,6
24390,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,"Oh, yeah! Weird!",surprise,6
24391,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,"But, um, why were we so terrible before?",surprise,6
24392,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,"I guess some ponies thrive on pressure and some ponies don't. And even though we weren't playing, we were treating you like us, which totally stressed you out.",sadness,6
24393,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,And that just sucked the fun right out of the game for you.,sadness,6
24394,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Rainbow Dash,"And having fun is what makes you really, really, really good!",joy,6
24395,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,But being good doesn't matter if we're too afraid of letting ponies down.,fear,6
24396,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,Yeah! What about all those ponies back in Ponyville counting on us to win?,joy,6
24397,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,"I'm sure folks want you to win, but not if worrying about it makes you miserable. Winning's never worth that.",joy,6
24398,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Fluttershy,But how do we keep from worrying about it?,fear,6
24400,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,Hm. Works for me!,joy,6

24406,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,Not think about it?,neutral,6

24409,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Pinkie Pie,[giggles] I think it's more fun this way!,joy,6
24412,Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,Applejack,Huh. Looks like you three made quite an impression!,surprise,6

She celebrates what makes them unique and listens when one of them finds a better way!,joy,6
25878,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,Starlight Glimmer,No! Stop!,fear,6
25881,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,Starlight Glimmer,Then don't! Sharing love is what made you different to begin with! You should share yours with Chrysalis! Give her all of it!,joy,6
25882,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,Starlight Glimmer,This is what happens when you give love freely instead of taking it!,joy,6
25883,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,Discord,Fluttershy?,joy,6
25884,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,Fluttershy,"It's, um, good to see you, too.",neutral,6
25885,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,Twilight Sparkle,Starlight? What happened?,surprise,6
25886,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,Starlight Glimmer,"We defeated the changelings with no magic at all, they found a new leader, and... they're all kinda... good now.",surprise,6
25888,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,Starlight Glimmer,"When Twilight and her friends defeated me, I chose to run away and seek revenge! You don't have to! You can be the leader your subjects deserve.",neutral,6
25891,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,Discord,Splendid idea! Now who's ready for some celebratory tea at Fluttershy's?!,joy,6
25892,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,Fluttershy,"Oh! Uh, everypony?",surprise,6
25893,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,Starlight Glimmer,"Actually, now that you can snap your claws and send us absolutely anywhere again, I think I have a better option.",surprise,6
25896,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,Starlight Glimmer,"Yeah... I guess after the way I used my magic on all of you, I wasn't sure I was somepony who should even be in charge of a baking contest. I was afraid I might go back to being the pony I used to be. But I realize that sometimes you don't have a choice. You have to step up. And I have changed! I can handle it. Whether that means saving Equestria or helping friends out with the Sunset Festival. Speaking of which, I know the Festival's almost over, but I kinda invited a few of my friends to join. Hope that's okay.",joy,6
25898,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,Starlight Glimmer,Great! Now where's that baking contest? This pony needs a cupcake!,joy,6
25899,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,Discord,So I'm able to rip the very fabric of reality again.,surprise,6
25901,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,Discord,"Actually, I was going to say a couple of those illusions were slightly above average. If you ever need a little chaos in your act, let me know.",joy,6
25904,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,Rainbow Dash,Somepony is really gonna have to catch us up on what we missed.,joy,6

25920,Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,Twilight Sparkle,"""Sparkle""? [laughs] Yeah, we are. So do you think she'll like it? I want this present to say, ""I'm so proud of you both as a mentor and a friend. Equestria is safer thanks to you.""",joy,7

25927,Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,Pinkie Pie,Hmmm.,neutral,7
25929,Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,Twilight Sparkle,"Starlight, Trixie, Thorax, and Discord were brave in the face of danger, resourceful when things got challenging, and proved that the bonds of friendship, no matter how unlikely, are stronger than any adversity. By stopping Queen Chrysalis, not only did they save Equestria; they set the changelings free from her reign.",joy,7

25945,Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,Twilight Sparkle,What's so funny?,joy,7
25946,Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,Discord,"No, no. Clearly, Starlight is beyond basic friendship lessons. She just won a medal, for Equestria's sake. I thought you were joking. You are joking, right?",surprise,7
25947,Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,Twilight Sparkle,[nervous laugh] Of course I was.,neutral,7
25948,Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,Discord,"Obviously, you should have a grand master plan for her, the same way Celestia set you on the path that eventually made you a princess.",neutral,7

25970,Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,Twilight Sparkle,"I had years worth of friendship lessons ready to go, but when we were captured by Chrysalis, Starlight took charge and really stepped up. I don't think friendship lessons are enough for her anymore.",joy,7
25972,Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,Twilight Sparkle,"That's why I had to talk to you. You, of all ponies, would know what to do. I mean, you were me and I was Starlight. But, for now, I need you to pretend you're you and I'm me.",neutral,7
25973,Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,Spike,Huh?,surprise,7
25975,Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,Twilight Sparkle,"When I was your student, and you were in this place, you<U+0097> Oh, no! You sent me to Ponyville! Which means it's time for me to send Starlight Glimmer away!",surprise,7

25982,Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,Applejack,Hmm. Wonder why she didn't tell any of us about it.,surprise,7

25984,Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,Pinkie Pie,"[squeals] That's so exciting! And surprising. Usually, you tell your party planner about all your plans for your party.",joy,7

25999,Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,Twilight Sparkle,Thank you.,joy,7
26001,Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,Spike,Yep. Definitely a Twilight fantasy.,neutral,7
26003,Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,Twilight Sparkle,Or dangerous. It would only take one changeling to deviate from the pack.,fear,7
26008,Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,Spike,"Uh, that probably won't happen.",neutral,7

26018,Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,Spike,Freaky.,fear,7

26029,Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,Spike,"Twilight, this is crazy!",surprise,7
26030,Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,Spike,Starlight's really good with magic. She could just stop herself from falling into a pit of lava.,surprise,7

Someplace safe, someplace safe, someplace safe... I could send her to the Crystal Empire to continue her magical studies with Sunburst!",fear,7

26036,Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,Twilight Sparkle,"Of course, the study of magic is a lifelong pursuit, and Starlight could be there for a while, especially once they start attempting the really complicated stuff!",joy,7

26038,Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,Twilight Sparkle,What if they become too ambitious?!,fear,7
26039,Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,Starlight Glimmer,I never would've thought to combine Star Swirl's apparition spell with Spacium Flexibus! But what would happen if we added Somnambula's Tempus Objectus?,surprise,7

26723,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,That is a big problem... that I'm going to fix for you! I already have the perfect solution that'll make the critters happy and give you more space. Then you'll have all your ducks in a row!,joy,7

26728,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Twilight Sparkle,A friendship problem?,neutral,7
26729,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,"No. Her vet clinic is a bit... maybe, um... overrun with adorable critters in dire need of a safe place to lay their heads, and... they don't have anywhere to go!",joy,7
26730,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,"Oh, that's just awful.",sadness,7
26731,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,I know!,joy,7
26732,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Applejack,"Yeah. Dr. Fauna's always fixin' Winona up when she ain't feelin' too fine, so helpin' her out is A-okay by me.",joy,7
26733,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Rainbow Dash,Hah! Yeah!,joy,7
26734,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,You can count on us!,joy,7

26738,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Pinkie Pie,"Oh, goody! Is your dream to make a bouncy castle shaped like a gigantic bundt cake?",joy,7
26739,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,"Um, no. Not exactly.",neutral,7
26740,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Pinkie Pie,Huh. Just me then.,surprise,7
26741,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Rainbow Dash,"So? What is it, Fluttershy? Spill!",surprise,7
26742,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,My dream is to build a real animal sanctuary.,joy,7
26743,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,"A beautiful habitat where every animal <U+0096> whether sick or scared or even just lonely, feathered or furry, scaly or slimy <U+0096> every critter would be welcome. My sanctuary can be the one place in Equestria they call home 'til they feel ready to take on the world.",joy,7
26744,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Twilight Sparkle,"Wow, Fluttershy! I've never heard you speak with such conviction.",surprise,7
26745,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,Oh! That was exquisite!,joy,7
26746,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Rainbow Dash,Pretty awesome.,joy,7
26747,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,"Oh, thank you, everypony. You all taught me so much about building my confidence over the years. It's because of your friendship that I finally feel able to make my dream project a reality. But I can't build the sanctuary alone. Will you join me?",joy,7
26748,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Applejack,"I'm happy to offer my extra hooves to ya. Huh. But come to think of it, I actually know a filly who'd be more help than I would. She's a friend of mine from Winona's sheep-herdin' competitions <U+0096> Wrangler! Heh. She's an expert in animal enclosures.",joy,7
26749,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,How lovely!,joy,7
26750,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Pinkie Pie,"Ooh-ooh-ooh! I know somepony, too! Hard Hat is the best construction pony in Ponyville. He can build anything you could ever, ever, ever want!",joy,7
26751,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,"Is it you, Rarity?",neutral,7
26752,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,"[chuckles] No! No. Um, I was referring to the premiere interior designer of the Canterlot elite <U+0096> Dandy Grandeur. He helped me when I was setting up my Canterlot boutique. I know that he'd be thrilled to work with you.",joy,7
26753,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,"Wow, everypony! Thank you! I can't wait to meet all of them and hear their ideas. We're right on track to building the most wonderful sanctuary in Equestria!",joy,7
26754,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,"Thank you, Rupert. Ahem. It's wonderful that you all could join me to discuss the Ponyville sanctuary project. My friends have so many nice things to say about each of your talents. This is a big project, so I'm happy to have such experienced ponies working on it with me.",joy,7
26756,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,I-I think so.,neutral,7
26758,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,Of course.,neutral,7
26760,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,"Um, not exactly. It's more of a dream board.",neutral,7
26762,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,"Well, that's because it's not. It's a sanctuary. A place that is safe but not restrictive. Cozy but natural. A place where the animals can come and go as they please.",joy,7
26763,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,"So, can you build it?",neutral,7
26765,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,"I want the sanctuary to have an open floor plan. No walls. More like an enclosure that melts into the trees. With a gate in the back. That way, the animals can return to the forest right when they feel ready.",joy,7
26766,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Pinkie Pie,Sneaky! I like it!,joy,7
26768,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,But I don't want to clear the trees. I want to use them.,anger,7
26770,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,"Critters don't live the same way ponies do. I know this is unconventional, but that's because we're trying to do something that's never been done before. I really believe it'll work.",joy,7
26772,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Pinkie Pie,"See, Fluttershy? Whatever you want.",joy,7
26773,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,Good.,joy,7
26777,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,Ooooh! Loving the print on those!,joy,7
26778,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,"Um, not to be rude, but there must be some mistake. We have no need for curtains at the sanctuary.",disgust,7
26780,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,"Everything is gonna look natural in the animal habitats, not like it was made for ponies.",neutral,7
26781,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,Drab? You're calling the colors of beautiful trees drab?,anger,7
26783,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,"I appreciate your input, but I just know the animals would be happiest with dirt brown pillows and leaf green accents.",joy,7
26785,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,Thank you.,joy,7
26788,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,Hmm.,neutral,7
26789,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Applejack,"Uh, what is it, sugarcube?",joy,7
26790,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,I'm looking for something less like a cage and more like a nice hug. Maybe if we lose that part.,joy,7
26792,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,Exactly! Ooh! This is the perfect base for a little nest. I'll take a bunch of these and anything else the animals can burrow into.,joy,7
26794,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Applejack,"She does have a point there. You wouldn't want a bunny wanderin' into the wrong cave, would ya?",neutral,7
26795,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,No! No cages. I want to give the animals the freedom to come and go. It's the only way they'll feel comfortable.,joy,7
26796,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Applejack,"Well, she's the boss.",neutral,7
26801,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,"I... I... [angry] I don't love it! This is not going to work at all! A giraffe can't fit through this door! With these curtains blocking the light, how are the birds gonna sing in the sunshine? And this is the opposite of a nice hug! I know you all worked hard, but none of you did anything I asked for!",anger,7
26805,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,"I may not know much about construction or interior design or wrangling, but I am an expert at one thing: the care of animals! And what animals need is a sanctuary, not this!",anger,7
26807,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,"My vision isn't the problem here! I told you all exactly what I wanted, and none of you listened to me! So while I appreciate your efforts, I no longer require your services!",anger,7
26810,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,No. I'm the one who should be sorry. This didn't go at all like I had imagined.,sadness,7
26811,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,"Sleep tight, little one. It's going to be okay. I promise.",joy,7

26813,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,[sighs] I'm so sorry. I thought I'd have a beautiful sanctuary for you all to stay in by now. But I put my trust in the wrong ponies.,sadness,7
26815,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,No!,anger,7
26816,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,"I won't give up! These animals need me! And I'm gonna solve this once and for all! If this little lady can crawl all the way here from Western Equestria, I can find a way to build her a safe place to rest!",joy,7
26817,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,Oh! [joins in laughter] Oops. Everyone back to sleep now.,joy,7
26818,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,"Thanks for coming, everypony. As you know, building the sanctuary didn't go quite as planned.",sadness,7
26819,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Pinkie Pie,"I know, right? Who would've guessed that Hard Hat wouldn't build whatever you want?",surprise,7
26820,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,I never would've invited Dandy to help if I thought he'd act in such a manner.,disgust,7
26821,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Applejack,"[sighs] And Wrangler sure made a fool outta me, too. I'm sorry, Fluttershy.",sadness,7
26822,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,It's okay. You were all just trying to help. But I know that letting all the experts go was the right call.,neutral,7
26823,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Twilight Sparkle,So what are you gonna do now?,neutral,7
26824,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,Try again. I'm going to rebuild the sanctuary and do it my way this time.,joy,7
26825,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Pinkie Pie,"All right, Fluttershy!",joy,7
26826,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Applejack,"[simultaneously] You show 'em, filly!",joy,7
26827,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,[simultaneously] That's the spirit!,joy,7
26828,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Rainbow Dash,How about putting an awesome flying course for the birds right there?,joy,7
26829,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Pinkie Pie,And a carrot cake stand here?,surprise,7
26830,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Twilight Sparkle,"Ooh, a library cave?",surprise,7
26831,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,"Everypony, stop! I appreciate you sharing your thoughts, but I need everypony to respect mine. Other ponies may be experts in their fields, but animals are my field of expertise. And if I say this is what I want, then this is what needs to happen! Oh, um, for the animals of course.",joy,7
26832,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Pinkie Pie,"Wow! We should call you ""Flutterbold"" now!",joy,7
26833,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,"To get things back on track, I called in a favor from an old friend. He'll be here any minute.",joy,7
26834,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Twilight Sparkle,I thought you said no more experts.,anger,7
26835,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,This is one expert I know I can trust to put the animals first. Plus there's nopony better at building.,joy,7
26837,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Twilight Sparkle,Big Daddy McColt! [to the others] We met each other back when the map called me and Fluttershy to the Smokey Mountains!,joy,7

26844,Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,Fluttershy,"Now you should have plenty of room at the clinic. Because once you've treated them, they can recover here! With my help, of course. It's okay, Lola. We all move at our own pace. Sometimes, all we need to do is believe in our dreams. And when we finally reach our goal, we'll know that it was worth what it took to get there, because the view will be even better than you imagined!",joy,7

27193,Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,Scootaloo,"For your entire life, your parents gave you the confidence to believe in yourself.",joy,7
27194,Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,Rainbow Dash,"You're right. I was always so embarrassed by my parents that I didn't realize their support actually made me the awesome, confident, amazing, awesome, and awesome pony I am! [sighs] And I took them for granted.",joy,7
27195,Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,Scootaloo,And you yelled at them.,anger,7

27262,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Apple Bloom,"I'm gonna ask you a very personal question, and I want you to answer honestly. Do you... have a crush on... Sugar Belle?",surprise,7
27264,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Scootaloo,"Well, that was easy.",joy,7
27265,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Apple Bloom,This is so excitin'! My big brother has his very first crush!,joy,7
27266,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Scootaloo,First crush? What about Cheerilee?,neutral,7
27267,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Sweetie Belle,"It doesn't really count when you trick a pony into drinking a love potion, does it?",disgust,7
27269,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Apple Bloom,[singsongy] My brother has a crush! My brother has a crush! My brother has a crush! [normally] Wait! Does Sugar Belle even know you like her?,joy,7
27271,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Apple Bloom,Then you gotta tell her!,joy,7
27273,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Sweetie Belle,"We're pretty sure she likes you! I mean, she keeps ordering apples just so she can see you again.",joy,7
27275,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Scootaloo,Totally! But you'll never know if you don't try.,joy,7
27277,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Scootaloo,"Go get her, Big Mac!",joy,7
27280,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Scootaloo,"Um, is it possible to have two crushes at once? Because it looks like Big Mac may not be the only pony Sugar Belle likes.",surprise,7
27281,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Apple Bloom,"Hey, Big Mac! Where ya goin'?",joy,7
27283,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Sweetie Belle,You can't let that Feather fella get in the way of your one true love!,joy,7
27284,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Scootaloo,You've gotta take him down!,anger,7
27285,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Apple Bloom,What can he do that you can't?,neutral,7
27288,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Scootaloo,Seriously? That line worked?,surprise,7
27290,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Apple Bloom,"Sure she will, 'cause we're gonna help you.",joy,7
27292,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Apple Bloom,"Don't worry, Big Mac. We learned our lesson the hard way.",joy,7
27293,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Scootaloo,Yeah. We're never gonna do that again.,sadness,7
27294,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Sweetie Belle,"Besides, I know exactly what to do! When I was younger, I read all the fairy tales.",joy,7
27295,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Scootaloo,"When you were ""younger"", huh?",surprise,7
27296,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Sweetie Belle,"Well, I was younger on the way here!",joy,7
27297,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Sweetie Belle,"It was a long ride! Anyway, as long as we do what the book says, you're pretty much guaranteed a happy ending. Uh, how about this one? ""Rescuing a damsel-pony-in-distress."" That's perfect! Of course, we'll have to improvise without a dragon.",joy,7
27298,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Apple Bloom,Huh. Too bad Spike isn't here. Not that he's very threatening.,neutral,7
27299,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Scootaloo,So what should we do? Wait around for Sugar Belle to get herself into a scary situation?,fear,7
27300,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Apple Bloom,Or... we bring the danger to her.,fear,7
27301,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Apple Bloom,"All right. Scootaloo's gonna pretend to take Sugar Belle's things, then you swoop in and stop her. Ready?",joy,7
27303,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Sweetie Belle,"Come on! You're gonna be her hero! In fairy tales, the knight in shining armor always gets the girl.",joy,7
27308,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Apple Bloom,That smooth-talkin' pony stole our rescue! And it totally would've worked!,anger,7
27310,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Sweetie Belle,"We're just gonna have to keep trying! Big Mac, are you ready to take it up a notch?",joy,7
27313,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Sweetie Belle,"Trust us! There's nothing more romantic than waking your special pony from a sleeping spell with a magical kiss! See? ""They rode off into the sunset.""",joy,7
27314,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Apple Bloom,Any sign of Feather Bangs?,neutral,7
27315,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Scootaloo,Negative! Coast is clear!,joy,7
27316,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Apple Bloom,"It's now or never, Big Mac!",joy,7
27318,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Sweetie Belle,Hey! That's our metaphorical sunset they're riding off into!,anger,7
27319,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Scootaloo,"All right! This ends now! Feather Bangs may have good timing, and... a good mane... uh, but let's see him compete with a song!",anger,7
27321,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Apple Bloom,Of course! Why didn't we think of it before?,surprise,7
27322,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Sweetie Belle,"Every great love story hinges on the romantic musical number. Big Mac, you've gotta write a song for Sugar Belle!",joy,7
27324,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Apple Bloom,"Come on, Big Mac!",joy,7
27327,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Apple Bloom,Come on! You can do better than him! Just like we practiced!,joy,7

27354,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Scootaloo,"Well, nopony's seen him.",neutral,7
27355,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Apple Bloom,"Aw, I feel terrible. I've never seen my brother so upset before. Oh, Big Mac?! Big Mac!",sadness,7
27356,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Sweetie Belle,Are you okay?,neutral,7
27358,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Apple Bloom,Sorry it didn't work out with Sugar Belle.,sadness,7
27359,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Sweetie Belle,"We don't get it. Big, grand gestures always work in the fairy tales.",sadness,7
27361,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Apple Bloom,That's it! We shoulda been thinking about what would mean a lot to Sugar Belle!,joy,7
27363,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Apple Bloom,Really? Even after we messed it up?,surprise,7
27366,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Scootaloo,"[fake voice] I shouldn't. Um, uh, I'm new in town. Mind showing me around?",neutral,7
27368,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Scootaloo,"[fake voice] Oh, no! Clumsy me! Here, let me help you clean it up!",joy,7
27369,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Sweetie Belle,I don't think Scootaloo can hold her off much longer.,fear,7
27370,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Scootaloo,"[fake voice] Uh, n-now hold on a minute. Are you sure I can't buy you a new bag?",surprise,7
27373,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Scootaloo,[normal voice] Ahhh! The cupcake has landed! Repeat <U+0096> the cupcake has landed! Oof!,surprise,7
27380,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Apple Bloom,That was the most romantic thing ever!,joy,7
27383,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Apple Bloom,"I'm Big Mac's little sister, and these are my friends. We're sorry for everything we put you through today, Sugar Belle. Big Mac never would've gone through with all of those crazy...",joy,7
27384,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Sweetie Belle,...over-the-top...,surprise,7
27385,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Scootaloo,...downright ridiculous...,anger,7
27386,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Apple Bloom,...attempts to impress you if we hadn't put him up to it. But we learned our lesson. Romance isn't about impressin' somepony. It's about doin' somethin' that means somethin' special to that pony you love<U+0097> Heh... [clears throat] like a lot.,joy,7
27387,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Sweetie Belle,"Uh, Apple Bloom, I think they get it.",neutral,7
27389,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Scootaloo,"Sorry, Feather. You're a little too late.",sadness,7
27390,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Apple Bloom,Yeah! Sugar Belle's already picked her special somepony!,joy,7
27391,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Sweetie Belle,But don't worry. You've got three not-so-secret admirers right behind you!,joy,7
27393,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Apple Bloom,"Uh, you're askin' us for advice?",surprise,7
27395,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Apple Bloom,"Gee, I don't know about this.",neutral,7
27396,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Scootaloo,"He just needs a little nudge in the conversation department. Besides, I don't think Big Mac's ready to leave just yet.",neutral,7
27397,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Sweetie Belle,Let's do it!,joy,7
27398,Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,Apple Bloom,"Feather Bangs, the Cutie Mark Crusaders are...",joy,7
27399,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,No. [chuckling] It's a call for submissions. Fashion contest I'm organizing. A showcase for aspiring young designers.,joy,7
27400,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Pinkie Pie,"Oh, wow! What an awesome idea!",joy,7
27401,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,Thank you. I remember how difficult it was to break into the fashion industry when I was starting out. That's why the winner of the contest will get to debut their line in the Carousel Boutique!,joy,7
27402,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Spike,[dreamily] So selfless... So generous...,joy,7
27403,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,I've also managed to get esteemed fashion critic Hoity Toity and iconic fashion photographer Photo Finish to come to Ponyville and judge the show. And... [squealing] Wait until you hear who else will be a judge.,joy,7
27404,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Spike,Countess Coloratura?,neutral,7
27405,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Pinkie Pie,Sassy Saddles?,neutral,7
27406,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Spike,Spike?!,surprise,7
27407,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,No! [chuckling] The third judge for the Carousel Boutique's Couture du Future Fashion Contest is none other than... Applejack!,joy,7
27408,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,What?!,surprise,7
27409,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Pinkie Pie,What?!,surprise,7
27410,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Spike,What?!,surprise,7
27411,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,...What?,surprise,7
27412,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,What?!,surprise,7
27413,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,"You already said that, darling.",neutral,7
27415,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Pinkie Pie,"I'm sure Rarity has her reasons, and once we hear them, all of this will make sense.",joy,7
27416,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,"I admit, Applejack is an unorthodox choice. But that is precisely what makes her an inspired choice!",joy,7
27417,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Pinkie Pie,See? Now it all... still doesn't make any sense.,sadness,7
27418,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,"Hoity Toity has expertise in fabric and stitchwork. Photo Finish has an artistic eye for shapes and colors. But sometimes, we designers forget about practicality. That's where you come in.",joy,7
27419,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,"Uh, I think I might be a little too practical. My closet's nothin' but twenty versions of this hat.",neutral,7
27420,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,"Which tells me you're a pony who knows what she likes. Besides, a judge must be honest, and you're the most honest pony there is. Ask any pony <U+0096> they'll tell you.",joy,7
27421,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Pinkie Pie,Ooh! Ooh! Lemme try! [to Cherry Fizzy] Excuse me. Have you ever heard of Applejack?,joy,7
27423,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,See? So what do you say?,neutral,7
27424,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,"Well, if I'm bein' honest, I don't think I'm the right pony for the job. Fashion just ain't my bag of oats.",sadness,7
27425,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Pinkie Pie,"Aw, booooo!",disgust,7
27426,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,"I do understand your hesitation. But before you say no, sleep on it?",neutral,7
27427,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,"Sure, I... guess I can do that for ya.",neutral,7
27428,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,"I mean, heh, can you imagine? Me, judgin' a fashion show?",surprise,7
27429,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Apple Bloom,I'd do it! It sounds like fun gettin' to see all those pretty outfits!,joy,7
27430,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,"Although... Rarity did say I just had to focus on practicality. She already has experts for the... uh, fashion-y stuff. Eh, but I still wouldn't know what to say.",neutral,7
27431,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,"Come on, Apple Bloom! You're doublin' our workload here!",anger,7
27432,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Apple Bloom,"Sorry. I wanted to wear a signature hat like yours, but it's makin' it harder to see.",neutral,7
27433,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Apple Bloom,"Wow! That is a lot better! Thanks, Applejack!",joy,7
27434,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,"Sure thing. You know what? I am gonna help Rarity judge her show! I think my sensible ""everypony"" take on fashion is exactly what the pony community needs!",joy,7
27435,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,"Rarity, I thought about it some more, and if you still need me, I'd love to be a judge.",joy,7
27436,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,[squeals] I just knew you'd come around!,joy,7
27439,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,[gasps] It's wonderful to see you! Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!,joy,7
27441,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,Thank you both so much for doing this. Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!,joy,7
27443,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,Miss Pommel is showing? I thought she was still making costumes.,surprise,7
27444,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,"Oh, my, they're absolutely stunning!",joy,7
27445,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,It sure is great to hear Miss Pommel is doin' so well.,joy,7
27447,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,"Oh, uh, this is Applejack. Another one of the judges.",neutral,7
27449,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,"Oh. Wow. Uh, that is just... wow. These are clothes?",surprise,7
27451,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,This is... [scoffs] She looks like a disco ball! Hah! D-Did they have to roll her down the runway?! [laughing] I can't believe anypony would actually wear this! [laughing] Am I right?,disgust,7
27454,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,[nervous chuckling] So funny... Ahem.,joy,7
27455,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,"Oh, gosh. I didn't mean to make her faint.",surprise,7
27456,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,"Oh, don't worry about it, darling. Uh, it happens all the time. Besides, that dress did look a bit like a disco ball. Although, Miss Pommel is making the point that, no matter what we wear, it is a costume of some kind or another.",joy,7
27457,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,I have no idea what you're talkin' about.,neutral,7
27458,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,And... that's okay. Let's go meet the designers and help them get ready for the show!,joy,7
27459,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,"Designers, welcome! Today you will work on your designs, and we judges will offer our guidance and advice as you prepare for tomorrow's big show.",joy,7
27460,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,"Lily Lace, tell us about your inspiration.",neutral,7
27463,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,Uh... Huh?,surprise,7
27464,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,"Next up, meet Starstreak.",joy,7
27469,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,"Applejack, you've been rather quiet. What do you think?",neutral,7
27470,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,Well... it's a lot of black. It's kinda... depressing.,sadness,7
27473,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,"Maybe to fashion experts like you. But to ponies like me, it's still black.",neutral,7
27474,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,And I'm not sure how you wear singin' birds or the future. [to Rarity] I don't think they liked what I had to say.,neutral,7
27475,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,"Ah, well, that's why you're here. Fashion needs a healthy dose of practicality now and then.",joy,7
27476,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,Are you puttin' holes in the clothes?! On purpose?!,anger,7
27478,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,"More like an old and tattered look! When a pony's old clothes get holes in 'em, they don't wanna go to the store to buy new clothes with holes in 'em!",disgust,7
27479,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,"Okay, yes, not a very practical choice. Fashionable, but not practical.",neutral,7
27481,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,"Sure, it looks pretty, but that's a lot of fabric. With the way it drags behind, it'll be covered in dirt in no time. Thank goodness I'm here. Otherwise, we'd have had holes in clothes and dirty dresses.",disgust,7
27482,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,"But of course, no look is complete without mane and makeup!",joy,7
27483,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,"So, uh... when are you gonna do her mane?",neutral,7
27485,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,"You know what? Uh, I think we've given the designers enough guidance for today. Let's, uh, let them finish their work.",neutral,7
27486,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,"Uh, can't wait to see what y'all do for the big show tomorrow!",joy,7
27490,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Pinkie Pie,"Hey, Applejack! On your way home? How'd the first day of the contest go?",joy,7
27491,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,"Heh! Great! At first, I didn't think I'd be much help. But thank goodness I signed on! Without me, they'd be doin' all kinds of crazy fashion-y things!",joy,7
27492,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Pinkie Pie,"Hey, Rarity! Applejack says the contest is going great! Good thing she's there, huh?",joy,7
27493,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,"Yes, of course... Some of her thoughts are tough to swallow, but hopefully her candor will help the designers achieve the best designs possible.",joy,7
27494,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,Sure... Hmm.,neutral,7
27495,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,[sighs] Much better.,joy,7
27496,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,"[inhale, exhale] I can meet my goals. Today is a fresh start. Good morning, everypony! Time for final adjustments before the show!",joy,7
27498,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,"To me, they convey wakin' up an hour early just to button 'em all! And that's if you could reach most of 'em!",joy,7
27500,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,"Heh. There you go! Now when it's cold, you just slide it on ya, and you're set. Like a poncho!",joy,7
27503,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,Who cares if it's stitched perfectly? You don't need feathers on your head!,anger,7
27505,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,"My little sister tried to add some flair to her hat, and guess what it got her <U+0096> an extra hour of work pickin' apples off the ground!",surprise,7
27510,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,"What? Oh, no. Uh, it's just, I mean... Those belts look the same.",surprise,7
27512,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,"You're kiddin', right?",surprise,7
27513,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,Is everything okay?,neutral,7
27514,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,They're havin' a heated debate about those two belts.,anger,7
27515,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,Ooh! Both good choices.,joy,7
27516,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,No! There is no choice! They're the exact same belt! Ugh! This is so silly! Fashion is ridiculous!,anger,7
27517,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,You don't mean that!,surprise,7
27518,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,"I do! I'm sorry, but that's my honest opinion!",joy,7
27521,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,No! Please! Come back!,sadness,7
27524,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,What? I was just bein' honest!,surprise,7
27525,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,Stop everything! There is no show! Take it all down!,anger,7
27526,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Pinkie Pie,"Rarity, what's going on? Is everything okay?",neutral,7
27527,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,No! It is the opposite of okay! The judges have quit! The designers have dropped out! The show is cancelled! All my good intentions squashed! [sobbing] And it's all Applejack's fault!,sadness,7
27528,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,Why are you mad at me?! I was just sayin' what I thought! And isn't that why you wanted me to be a judge?! For my honesty?!,anger,7
27529,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,Of course! But you said fashion is ridiculous!,anger,7
27530,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,But it's my opinion! And I'm not gonna lie!,anger,7
27531,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,Oh<U+0097>! [scoffs] Come with me!,surprise,7
27533,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,"Hello, Strawberry Sunrise. This is Applejack. I was wondering if you could tell her how you feel about apples.",joy,7
27535,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,"What?! Why?! They're crunchy, they're sweet, they're delicious.",surprise,7
27536,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,You're right! Apples are better than strawberries!,joy,7
27538,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,[stammering] You'd better apologize!,anger,7
27540,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,"Applejack, why are you so angry? It's just Strawberry's honest opinion. What's wrong with that?",anger,7
27541,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,"Well, that's fine if she doesn't like 'em! But if she knew how hard we worked to make our apples perfect, maybe she wouldn't be so mean about<U+0097>! ...Ohhhhhhh... Oh, boy.",sadness,7
27542,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,"Mm-hmm. Doesn't feel so good, does it?",sadness,7
27543,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,"Nope. No, it does not at all. [sighs] I am so sorry, Rarity. I got so carried away with bein' honest, I guess I didn't think about how I was makin' others feel. [sighs] I'm a real rotten apple.",sadness,7
27544,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,"I appreciate that, Applejack. That means a lot. I just wish you'd realized it before you ruined the fashion show.",sadness,7
27549,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,Yup. But you're not goin' back to Canterlot yet.,anger,7
27550,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,Hey!,joy,7
27554,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,"Whew... Listen, y'all. I thought I was just bein' honest when I said all those things. But somepony helped me realize I was actually bein' hurtful. So for that, I apologize.",joy,7
27556,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,"Uh... Well, I, uh... I still don't understand it. But I appreciate how much it means to y'all and how much hard work you put into it. I also know this contest is important to Rarity. So what do you say?",joy,7
27560,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,Anything.,neutral,7
27562,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,"Show's back on, fellers!",joy,7
27563,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,[grunting] Ahhh...,disgust,7
27564,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,Aah!,surprise,7
27566,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Pinkie Pie,"...And then, Applejack found me and told me to distract you for an hour. But the hour's up! Ta-da!",joy,7
27567,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,B-B-But how?! They were all leaving. This was all coming down.,fear,7
27569,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,I don't think that word means what you think it means. But I did bust my tail because I know how much this means to you.,neutral,7
27570,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,"Ohhhhh! Thank you, Applejack.",joy,7
27572,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,"First up, Lily Lace!",joy,7

27574,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,Inky Rose!,joy,7
27575,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,"And now, it's time to vote. I am drawn to the beauty and drama of fashion, and nopony does drama better than Lily Lace, so I vote for her.",joy,7
27580,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,"Well, it all comes down to you, Applejack.",neutral,7
27581,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Pinkie Pie,"Can you believe it?! After everything that's happened, Applejack is the deciding vote! [screams] This is so exciting! Eeeeee!",surprise,7
27582,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,"Well, Applejack?",neutral,7
27583,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Applejack,[sucks air through teeth] Uh... Heh. U-Uh... Uh...,surprise,7
27584,Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,Rarity,"Lily Lace's clothes go here, Inky Rose's will go there, and Starstreak's there.",neutral,7

27596,A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,Twilight Sparkle,"Don't worry. For all we know, it's something small. Like maybe the cooks are fighting over who has the best butternut squash soup. Or the royal hairdressers are fighting over a comb.",joy,7

27610,A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,Starlight Glimmer,"That's basically what the princesses did when I said there was a friendship problem. Only they did it more, you know, regally.",neutral,7

27985,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Discord,"[chuckling] Oh, interesting. Does it decorate your hips in roses or turn you green?",joy,7
27987,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Discord,How boring. Pass. Hold on! Ginseng tea! Now that sounds promising. What does it sing? I'm partial to something upbeat and jazzy.,joy,7
27989,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Discord,So... all of this is just tea you simply drink?,surprise,7

28001,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Discord,A teapot that just pours tea? How positively dreadful!,disgust,7
28003,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Discord,"Now, let's see. I have the perfect tea and the perfect tea service. What else do I need for the perfect tea party? Oh! Decorations, of course!",joy,7
28004,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Discord,"[chuckles] Better. Oh! I'll need napkins. I'll simply make them... ah, well, I could... or... No. I've got nothing. How do I make these better? What should I do? Make them... [gasps, snaps fingers] Make them glow! Oh, that's not good enough for Fluttershy. Should I make them fly? Glow, fly, and [chuckles] and fold! Glow, fly, fold into fun shapes, perhaps?",joy,7

[snaps fingers] As the party pony and Fluttershy's close <U+0096> but not best <U+0096> friend, I need your advice. I'm hosting a tea party for her, and it has to be perfect. No! It has to be even better than perfect!",joy,7
28007,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Pinkie Pie,"Oh, Discord. You're waaaaaay overthinking things. All you have to do is make Fluttershy feel comfortable. It should be pretty easy for you. You know her so well!",joy,7

28011,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Discord,"Make Fluttershy feel comfortable, make Fluttershy feel comfortable, comfortable, comfortable... Well, I mean, that shouldn't be a problem.",joy,7
28012,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Discord,"Oh, dear. That might be a problem.",fear,7
28013,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Discord,Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Maybe Fluttershy would be comfortable having a tea party here.,joy,7
28014,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Discord,Maybe I just need another set of eyes on this. What do you think?,neutral,7
28015,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Discord,That bad?,surprise,7
28019,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Discord,"What to do, what to do, what to do... Oh!",joy,7

28059,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Discord,Whatever do you mean?,surprise,7

28077,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Fluttershy,"[whimpers] Okay. Hmm. Maybe I need to start thinking like you. Ohhh... What would Discord do? Well, I guess he'd probably make another version of himself to bounce ideas off of.",neutral,7
28078,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Fluttershy,But one wouldn't be enough. He'd need more! Way more!,surprise,7
28079,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Fluttershy,"[to her reflections] Hey there, Fluttershys! Any ideas on how to Discord up this tea party? [higher-pitched] Hi, Fluttershy! Thanks for asking! First of all, you gotta redecorate this place. I mean, this is where Discord lives! And you're telling me there aren't any stairs that lead to nowhere? [speaking normally] On it!",joy,7
28080,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Fluttershy,"Better... but it still needs something. Now, that's more like it!",joy,7
28081,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Fluttershy,"[gasps] It's working! Okay, what else? Furniture on the ground? So predictable! Let's put them where they don't belong!",surprise,7
28082,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Fluttershy,And he'd have a chaise lounge that would actually chase you! Because he's funny like that! Bet you can't catch me!,joy,7
28083,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Fluttershy,Oh! And Discord would have a special kind of tea! Like a ginseng that could really sing!,joy,7
28084,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Fluttershy,"And he'd serve it on a floating table! We never talked about it, but I'm pretty sure Discord hates gravity!",joy,7
28085,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Fluttershy,[laughs] Now this is exactly what I was hoping for!,joy,7
28086,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Discord,This is what you were hoping for? But this is the complete opposite of your tea parties.,surprise,7
28087,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Fluttershy,I wouldn't expect you to throw a tea party the way I would. We're different!,joy,7
28088,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Discord,"I know. I was afraid that if you saw exactly how different we are, you wouldn't want to be friends anymore.",fear,7
28089,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Fluttershy,What?! Why would you ever think that?,surprise,7
28090,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Discord,Because you and I don't make sense to anypony else.,sadness,7
28091,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Fluttershy,"That may be true, but we make sense to me. I never would've thought to make singing ginseng before I met you. But you've opened me up to so many more possibilities and impossibilities. So I guess what I'm trying to say is I like you because you're so different from me.",joy,7
28092,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Discord,You do?,surprise,7
28093,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Fluttershy,"Of course I do, silly! Besides, what's discord without a little chaos?",joy,7

28095,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Discord,Oops! [laughs] I forgot that I still had this on!,joy,7
28096,Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Fluttershy,"[giggling] Now, about that tea party...",joy,7

28133,The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,Applejack,"Listen, sugarcube. Anytime Big Mac and I ever asked Granny about the feud or the Pears, she'd get so upset she couldn't talk. Best not bring it up.",sadness,7
28134,The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,Apple Bloom,"O-Okay, but that Grand Pear was really nice to me, even though I'm an Apple. I wonder what happened.",surprise,7
28135,The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,Applejack,"Me, too. But if we can't ask Granny, I don't know who<U+0097> We can ask Goldie Delicious! If anypony knows about the feud, it's the family historian!",joy,7

28549,Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,Spike,Ember's here!,joy,7
28550,Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,Twilight Sparkle,I know. I saw you coming and had to distract Thorax by showing him chairs. Why did you bring Ember to the castle of all places?,anger,7

28579,Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,Starlight Glimmer,"No! I mean, yeah, but that's castle food. If you want the good stuff, we gotta go to town. Phew!",joy,7

28619,Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,Spike,Noooo!,sadness,7
28626,Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,Spike,[panicked] Equestria as we know it is over! The war that pits changeling against dragon is about to begin! And it's all my fault! My title of Equestria's friendship ambassador is a lie<U+0097>! Oh. Hey. You guys aren't fighting?,fear,7
28628,Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,Spike,Because I accidentally invited you both over to Ponyville on the same day?,surprise,7

28677,Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,Spike,No way! It's finally happening! I solved the friendship problem!,joy,7

28690,Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,Apple Bloom,"But the more we do it, the better we get at camping. Remember the first time we came here and Rarity had that ginormous tent?",joy,7

28725,Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,Applejack,"Well, it's true. Rockhoof was known far and wide for his incredible strength. But he didn't start out that way. You see, Rockhoof was a tiny little fella, the son of a farmer.",joy,7
28726,Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,Apple Bloom,Just like us!,joy,7

28740,Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,Sweetie Belle,Wait a minute. All by himself?,surprise,7
28741,Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,Rainbow Dash,"It'd be impossible for one pony to dig a trench fast enough to stop the lava. I mean, even I couldn't do that.",neutral,7

Sweetie Belle, have I ever told you about my favorite legend?",joy,7
28754,Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,Sweetie Belle,No. I didn't know you had one.,neutral,7

28786,Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,Rarity,[narrating] She made a huge sacrifice to bring that smile back to her friends' and family's faces... including Sable Spirit's.,joy,7

29676,Marks and Recreation,May Chan,Scootaloo,We just wanted to apologize for not finding anything you liked today.,sadness,7

29688,Marks and Recreation,May Chan,Sweetie Belle,Everypony wants to know what they're meant to do!,joy,7
29692,Marks and Recreation,May Chan,Sweetie Belle,That's silly. Having a cutie mark doesn't mean you can't do other things.,joy,7
29693,Marks and Recreation,May Chan,Apple Bloom,"Yeah! Our cutie marks are in helpin' other ponies with their cutie marks, but I still like makin' potions with Zecora.",joy,7

29697,Marks and Recreation,May Chan,Sweetie Belle,Okay. Maybe we will be doing that more than anything else. But we love being Cutie Mark Crusaders!,joy,7
29699,Marks and Recreation,May Chan,Scootaloo,A blank flank who doesn't want a cutie mark? That's gotta be the strangest thing I've ever heard.,surprise,7

29704,Marks and Recreation,May Chan,Scootaloo,And we've got a whole camp full of ponies who are interested in getting cutie marks.,joy,7
29715,Marks and Recreation,May Chan,Sweetie Belle,"All right, cutie mark campers, that's it for jam-making!",joy,7
29717,Marks and Recreation,May Chan,Scootaloo,You don't get a cutie mark just because you're good at something or even because you like it. There's more to it than that.,neutral,7

29758,Marks and Recreation,May Chan,Sweetie Belle,I just can't see what we did wrong. I thought everypony was having fun.,sadness,7
29759,Marks and Recreation,May Chan,Apple Bloom,They were until that Rumble came and made a mess of things. What are they doing now?,neutral,7
29760,Marks and Recreation,May Chan,Scootaloo,It looks like whatever they want.,neutral,7
29761,Marks and Recreation,May Chan,Sweetie Belle,"Honestly, it's not all that different from what they were doing here.",neutral,7
29762,Marks and Recreation,May Chan,Apple Bloom,Then what was the point?,sadness,7
29763,Marks and Recreation,May Chan,Scootaloo,Point is that Rumble is a madpony who must be stopped!,anger,7
29764,Marks and Recreation,May Chan,Sweetie Belle,"Now calm down, Crusaders. We just need to talk to him again. The key is to remain calm.",joy,7

29784,Marks and Recreation,May Chan,Apple Bloom,"Well, that doesn't make a lick of sense. Unless... he was bein' bad at stuff on purpose!",surprise,7
29786,Marks and Recreation,May Chan,Scootaloo,Afraid of what?,fear,7
29788,Marks and Recreation,May Chan,Scootaloo,"I don't understand. If Rumble wants to be a Wonderbolt someday, what's wrong with that?",neutral,7
29790,Marks and Recreation,May Chan,Apple Bloom,Sounds to me like Rumble isn't afraid of bein' put in a box at all.,neutral,7
29791,Marks and Recreation,May Chan,Sweetie Belle,It doesn't?,neutral,7
29792,Marks and Recreation,May Chan,Apple Bloom,Nope. I think Rumble's already picked out a box. He's afraid he'll get a cutie mark that'll keep him from it.,fear,7

29805,Marks and Recreation,May Chan,Scootaloo,"But on the ground, since not everypony has wings.",neutral,7
29813,Marks and Recreation,May Chan,Apple Bloom,That haiku pretty well sums it up.,joy,7
29814,Marks and Recreation,May Chan,Scootaloo,Looks like Thunderlane was right about the obstacle course getting Rumble to come back over.,joy,7
29815,Marks and Recreation,May Chan,Sweetie Belle,"Hey, Rumble. Aren't you gonna do our Wonderbolt course?",joy,7

29824,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Spike,"Come on, Twilight. Even Princess Celestia takes a break sometimes, and she raises the sun.",joy,7
29825,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Spike,"You need a vacation! I can keep track of the friendship log, boost community morale, and answer fan mail for a few days.",joy,7

29854,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,"Eh. I just want to see you all have a good time. And this works out perfectly, because we have room for the one thing I wanna do! Our ship passes the Frozen North at sunset, which is the only time you can see the astrological phenomenon known as the Northern Stars. It's like the stars are shooting out of the setting sun!",joy,7
29856,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,Then it's settled. Hmm. But we don't have anything to do right now. Any suggestions?,neutral,7
29861,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,How'd he know that? And why announce it on a cruise?,surprise,7

29881,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,And the theme of this vacation is...,neutral,7
29883,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,"Iron Will, I'm not sure it was entirely honest of you to offer this cruise to my family without telling us that ponies bought tickets just to see Cadance and me!",anger,7
29891,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,"Wait! Iron Will, what if I offered you a deal? If I agree to do whatever princess activities you want, will you promise that my family gets to do the activities they want?",fear,7
29893,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,"I don't want the vacation to end now or let down all these ponies who were looking forward to seeing us. So what do you say, Iron Will? Do we have a deal?",joy,7
29895,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,Great! So it looks like we have some time before Dad plays Bingo.,joy,7
29897,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,Oh. Well... [chuckles] who doesn't like prizes?,joy,7

29931,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,"Cadance, I'm so glad you got in the Peewee Princess Playtime!",joy,7
29933,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,That's great. I'm just on my way to take some old-time Appleloosan photos!,joy,7
29934,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,And then do a quick question-and-answer session on becoming an Alicorn before Mom's barrel ride at Neighagra Falls! I really hope I don't miss that.,joy,7
29936,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,"Mind? What? Absolutely not. I mean, you guys are having fun, right? [sighs] Besides, I have to make sure these cruise ponies are happy if I want to be a good princess.",neutral,7
29938,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,"Honestly, as long as I get to see the Northern Stars tonight with everypony, I'll be happy. But right now, I gotta go take some pictures. See you later!",joy,7
29941,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, why did that last question have to be a two-parter? I just hope I have time for one barrel ride with Mom!",joy,7
29944,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,Disappointed? No! I've just been answering some detailed questions about Alicorns! You know how much I love details!,joy,7
29946,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,How can I when it's a totally successful vacation?,joy,7
29950,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,[sighs] How long have you been waiting?,neutral,7
29954,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,"[suddenly indignant] Oh, yeah. The cruise ponies are happy. My family is happy. Even Iron Will is happy.",anger,7
29955,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,You know who isn't happy? Me!,sadness,7
29957,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,[insincerely] I'm sorry. But maybe that wouldn't have happened if you weren't practically standing on my tail! Not even my real family stands so close! Rrgh!,anger,7
29959,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,I only made that deal with Iron Will so my family and the cruise ponies could have the vacation they wanted.,joy,7
29961,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,I just want everypony to be happy.,joy,7
29963,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,You seem to know pretty well.,joy,7
29965,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,"[sighs] You're right. I think I need to set some boundaries. But first, I owe somepony an apology.",neutral,7
29969,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,"No, Star Tracker. You should stay. I have something to tell you. All of you. I'm glad you all got to do the things you wanted, but I should have stood up for myself so that I could do what I wanted, too. [to Star Tracker] It wasn't fair of me to lash out at you. If I felt like you were standing too close, I should have said something. I'm sorry. [to everypony] What do you say we do something off the schedule?",joy,7
29971,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,"Yup! We're gonna do something I want us to do, as a family. Honorary members, too.",joy,7
29974,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,Ohhh!,surprise,7
29978,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,"It's okay, everypony. [through microphone] [clears throat] First, I want to thank all of you for coming. It means a lot that you'd spend your hard-earned bits just to be with us. But I honestly came on this cruise to take some time off from being a princess. I'm just a pony, too, after all. And even though I want everypony here to be happy, I'd really like to spend the rest of the cruise relaxing with my family.",joy,7
29985,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,There's still plenty of activities. We pass Fillydelphia on the way back. I could give Flurry Heart a quick history tour.,joy,7
29988,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,"You did all this for me? This is amazing! Thank you. And Shining Armor, I can't believe you're up there even though you're airsick!",joy,7
29992,Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,Twilight Sparkle,Now this is the only activity I need.,joy,7
29993,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,"Okay. All we need is a dot of salt, a dab of sugar, and a spritz of ginger.",joy,7
29994,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Twilight Sparkle,Uh... Are those real measurements? How do you keep track without a recipe?,surprise,7
29995,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,Pie baking is more art than science. And this will be my masterpiece! It's to celebrate Rainbow Dash's seventy-third Wonderbolt training session!,joy,7
29996,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Twilight Sparkle,Seventy-third? That's specific.,surprise,7
29997,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,"I know! The pie is blueberry because Wonderbolt outfits are blue. The crust is rainbow, for obvious reasons. But the most special part is the seventy-three super secret sweets and spices that represent each training session! [giggles] Could you please pass the... [quickly] brown sugar, pink sugar, sweetroot, apple jelly, berry mash, and a towel?",joy,7
29998,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Twilight Sparkle,You sure are going to a lot of trouble for Rainbow Dash's pie.,joy,7
29999,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,"Phew! That's because I know how much she loves them! My pies are her favorite! It's worth all the trouble to see her happy. Now I'm going to need some cocoa powder, cocoa flakes<U+0097> Ooh! Cocoa bar! [chomp] [mouthful] Want some?",joy,7
30000,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Twilight Sparkle,Isn't that for the pie?,neutral,7
30001,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,"[gulps, laughing] Oh, Twilight! That's hilarious! You don't mix chocolate into a blueberry pie! This is my mid morning, pie-making chocolate fuel that keeps this pie baking train chugging down the tracks! [chomp, babbles, gulp] Break time's over! Now let's finish this pie! Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga, choo-choo!",joy,7
30003,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Rainbow Dash,My seventy-third training session? That's specific.,surprise,7
30004,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,"I know! I'm just so proud and happy for you, and I've been counting all your training sessions, and I was going to wait until your hundredth, but I got too excited, and I know how much you love pie, so happy seventy-third training session!",joy,7
30005,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Rainbow Dash,Whaaa?! You didn't have to do this.,surprise,7
30006,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,"I know I didn't have to, but I reeeally wanted to! [squealing] Have a bite.",joy,7
30007,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Rainbow Dash,"Whoa! What's that?! Huh. Guess it was nothing. But wow, heh. This pie is the best I've ever had! Mmm! Is that cinnamon?",surprise,7
30008,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,I knew you'd love it! Have more. I made the whole thing for you.,joy,7
30009,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Rainbow Dash,"Really? Oh, that's so great! But I need to go change. A-And then I have to take Tank to the vet. Heh. His sensitive tortoise tummy's been acting up again. Do you mind if I take this pie with me?",joy,7
30010,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,Of course not! I gotta get back to my shift at Sugarcube Corner anyway. Congratulations again!,joy,7
30011,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Rainbow Dash,Heh. Thanks.,joy,7
30012,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,[sighs] I knew she'd love it. [gasps deeply] Is that...? Is that...?!,surprise,7
30013,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,Stop!,fear,7
30014,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,"You didn't see a blueberry rainbow-crust seventy-three-ingredient pie with a slice eaten out of it in here, did you?",surprise,7
30016,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,"Right. Of course you didn't. That would be ridiculous. Because I made it for Rainbow Dash, and she loves my pies. She would never throw them away like trash in the trash with other trash, right? Right?!",fear,7
30018,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,"Hmmm... That pie couldn't have been the one I made. I must be seeing things. I did have a lot of chocolate this morning. [chomp, gulps] But what if I wasn't seeing things? What if that was my pie? [scoffs] That would be bananas! [chuckles, laughing crazily] [gasps] Unless Rainbow Dash's been replaced by an imposter who throws delicious pies away!",surprise,7
30019,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,Or... has she been brainwashed by a pie-hating evil queen?,surprise,7
30020,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,"You make a good point. Rainbow Dash is too stubborn to be brainwashed. Plus she hates washing. Hmm. There's something else going on here. Let's look up a few of the more recent pies I've made for her. The boysenberry pie I made for her birthday... and her three half-birthday lemon meringues... and the ""It's Not Your Birthday But Here's a Pie Anyway Day"" custard pie! She ate all of these... Right?",joy,7
30021,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Rainbow Dash,[gasps] Another pie!? Thank you so much! Whoa! What's that?!,surprise,7
30022,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Rainbow Dash,[chewing noises] Huh. Guess it was nothing. Heh-heh.,surprise,7
30023,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Rainbow Dash,"Awesome! Three lemon meringues? Uh... Hey, what's that over there?",joy,7
30024,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Rainbow Dash,"[chewing noises] Oh, never mind. Heh. Great pies!",joy,7
30025,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,"Happy ""It's Not Your Birthday But Here's a Pie Anyway"" Day!",joy,7
30026,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Rainbow Dash,Thank you! No way! Check that out!,surprise,7
30028,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Rainbow Dash,"Oh, sorry. Guess it was nothing. [slurp] Mmm! But that custard was everything!",joy,7
30029,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,Have I ever really seen Rainbow Dash eat one of my pies? And do I always look when somepony points behind me? What's there?! Heh. Good one. But I need answers.,surprise,7
30030,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,"I've sent Rainbow Dash a pie every month she's been a Wonderbolt, and you're telling me you've never seen her eat one?",surprise,7
30033,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,Hmm... Interesting. Very interesting.,surprise,7
30035,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,"As chief detective on the pie case, I've labeled you all ponies-of-interest. So it's best you tell me everything you know.",anger,7
30037,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,[gasps] Would you be able to pick these pies out of a line up?,surprise,7
30038,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,I hear Rainbow Dash's pet tortoise Tank has been having tummy troubles. When did it start?,neutral,7
30040,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,"Hmmm... And this all happened the day after I made Rainbow Dash a ""Thanks For Lending Me Your Jacket"" peach pie. It seems the pieces of the puzzle are plopping into place, but the picture isn't pretty. [gasps] Note to self <U+0096> P. Alliteration Pie. Is that everything, Doctor?",joy,7
30042,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,Interesting. Did you have the lab analyze the flavor of that pie?,neutral,7
30044,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,Perhaps. And I just might know Pony Patient Zero!,surprise,7
30046,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,Indeed. But where do these pies come from?,neutral,7
30048,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,"Did you say the day after her half-birthday?! Very, very interesting. Because I give her a pie on her half-birthday every year! And I have a feeling it's the same pie.",surprise,7
30050,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,I'm so glad. At least I can be sure somepony is.,joy,7
30051,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,"She didn't eat the blueberry. She didn't eat the banana. She didn't eat the cream, and she didn't eat the chocolate. She didn't eat any of 'em! Why?! And don't tell me this all just started recently! It's been going on for years! Cheerilee said so herself. If there's one thing I know, you can't escape the truth!",anger,7
30052,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Applejack,Pinkie Pie?! Pinkie Pie!,joy,7
30053,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Applejack,Whooooaaaa! [grunting] Oh. Party-planning cave. Right. You okay? Or are you just screamin' for fun?,surprise,7
30054,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,"Screaming is fun. But I'm not okay! I've been making Rainbow Dash pies for years, but she doesn't even like them. She's been lying to me!",sadness,7
30055,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Applejack,But everypony loves your pies. they're the greatest thing since sliced apples.,joy,7
30056,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,Thank you!,joy,7
30057,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Applejack,And I could swear I've seen her eat one of your pies before.,surprise,7
30058,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,Have you reeeaaally?,surprise,7
30059,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Applejack,"Um, I... thought I had. That's why I said it?",neutral,7
30060,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,Are you sure?,neutral,7
30061,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Applejack,Maybe I haven't...?,neutral,7
30062,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,Exactly! Because it's all been a sham! Rainbow Dash has been laughing at my pies behind my back and scheming of a way to get rid of them for years!,anger,7
30063,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Rainbow Dash,Bring forth the worst-tasting food in all of Equestria!,disgust,7
30064,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Rainbow Dash,"And now I will destroy Pinkie Pie's horrid abominations, freeing the land of these disgusting pies forever!",anger,7
30065,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,Nooooooo!,sadness,7
30066,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Rainbow Dash,"Good riddance, strawberry cream and peaches 'o plenty! Begone, apple crumble and lemon surprise!",joy,7
30067,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Applejack,I really don't think that's what's happening.,neutral,7
30068,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,I don't think so either. I know so.,joy,7
30069,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Applejack,"Well, I've got just the thing to get your mind off all this madness. We've had a great apple harvest, so I was hopin' you could whip up a few of your delicious pies.",joy,7
30070,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,"Yes. I will make pies. Lots of pies. I'm going to make Rainbow Dash so many pies, it'll force her to admit the truth. Or I'll catch her in the act of getting rid of them. Operation: ""Pie of Lies"" is a go. Thanks, Applejack. I knew I could count on you to come up with a plan.",joy,7
30072,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,Surprise!,surprise,7
30073,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Rainbow Dash,[yelps] W-W-What's happening?!,fear,7

30131,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Rainbow Dash,"No! Well, not that I can think of off the top of my head. Is it my fault that I don't like pies? And not just Pinkie's pies. All pies! I know how much she loves making pies, and if I told her I didn't like them, it would have crushed her.",sadness,7
30132,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Applejack,"Uh, you kinda crushed her anyway.",sadness,7
30133,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Rainbow Dash,"Oh, but I...! [stutters, sighs] You're right. I guess I should've just eaten the pies in the first place. [gasps] Wait! That's it! I know how I can make it up to her!",joy,7

30136,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Rainbow Dash,"Pinkie Pie, wait! I know now that I should've been honest with you from the start, because lying to your friends is wrong.

30137,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,"Yes, I know exactly how many. I have a very detailed pie-ling system.",joy,7
30138,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Rainbow Dash,"Of course you do. The point is I thought the hassle was worth it just to spare your feelings, but I was wrong. So to make up for it, I made this pie for you. Well, I guess I made it for me. To eat in front of you. Point is I'm eating this pie for friendship!",joy,7
30139,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,Wait. That smelly circular monstrosity is a pie?,disgust,7
30140,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Rainbow Dash,"Yeah! I know I can't go back and eat all the pies you made for me in the past, so instead I'm going to eat this one giant one for you now. So here I go.",joy,7

30142,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,Wait! I can't watch you do this!,fear,7

30154,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Rainbow Dash,Heh. I know it does.,joy,7
30155,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,You did a lot of ridiculous and overly complex things to get rid of my pies because it made you happy to see me happy. Just like I went to a lot of effort to make you the pies because it made me happy to see you happy.,joy,7
30156,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Rainbow Dash,Yes!,joy,7
30157,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,"And if you're willing to go through all of that, it really shows how much you're willing to do for your friends.",joy,7

30159,Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,Pinkie Pie,Now get out of that thing and give me a hug!,joy,7

31358,Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,Rarity,"Oh, darling, it's easy to track. The store is divided into sections <U+0096> chic, classic, modern, sophisticated, avant-garde, traditional, and obtuse. And, of course, each section is divided by season, color, and price.

31409,Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,Fluttershy,[snooty voice] It's an unique play on the old standard. We call it a Rarity cut with a triple-cut stitched hem and a guacamole chevka pattern fabric.,joy,8

32553,The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,Spike,Ugh.,disgust,8
32554,The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,Spike,"Okay. Things seem bad. Maybe they're really not. Maybe ""we're finished"" was about the day. Ponies say that, right? Like-like, ""Hey, remember yesterday? That's finished, 'cause it's today!""",joy,8
32555,The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,Spike,"Maybe not that. Oh, I know! Maybe Sugar Belle has a wacky cousin who's never been on his own, and she has to leave him in charge of her shop while she apprentices with Mrs. Cake, who does that, like, two days a week. N-No, no, three. That's why she won't need you to come to her village anymore, because... she'll already be here!",joy,8

32559,The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,Discord,Lesson one <U+0096> nothing can break your heart if you only love yourself. You've got to show everypony that you're too cool to be bothered with so-called love. Observe.,neutral,8
32560,The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,Discord,"This is how cool guys lean against things. When you see a guy leaning against a thing looking this cool, you think, ""Wow! That guy doesn't have a care in Equestria. Not a guy who leans on things that cool.""",joy,8

32565,The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,Apple Bloom,"Okay. We finished decoratin' the barn for Big Mac, which means we got the rest of the day to ourselves. There's a whole town of possible admirers out there and only three of us. But together, we're gonna get to the bottom of this! Ready? Break! Excuse me! Pipsqueak? Mind answerin' a few questions? No? Late for somethin'? Are you Sweetie Belle's secret admirer?!",joy,8

32580,The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,Spike,"Okay. I think we've had enough of the aloof master of chaos remedies for a broken heart. You know what I do when I have a problem too big to solve?

33147,The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,Pinkie Pie,"You know what, Twilight? Maybe if you weren't so worried about schedules, you'd realize you're the one ruining the retreat for your friends!",anger,8
33148,The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,Twilight Sparkle,"[gasps] Well, if my friends don't care about the retreat I planned for them... maybe they should've stayed home!",anger,8
33155,The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,Rainbow Dash,[to Applejack] I'm guessing some kind of curse? Maybe poison joke?,surprise,8
33156,The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,Applejack,"Well, somethin' sure ain't right.",anger,8

33182,The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,Twilight Sparkle,"Everypony, quiet! Listen. We know each other really well <U+0097> the great stuff and how to get on each other's nerves, too. I wanted a fun trip with my friends. But instead, I got carried away with plans and ruined everything. If you want to forget it all and head home, I won't be offended. I just want us to stop fighting.",sadness,8

33244,A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,Starlight Glimmer,Then why not put him in charge?,surprise,8
33245,A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,Spike,"No-ho-ho, thanks. Eh, being a princess for Twilight was hard enough.",joy,8

33259,A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,Discord,"To fill in for Twilight, of course, as head-draconequus. I seem to recall a whole song about how this school is where you make your own rules. Now, who better at that than me?",joy,8
33260,A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,Spike,Then you also must've heard Starlight is in charge now.,neutral,8
33261,A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,Discord,Really? I thought there must be some mistake.,surprise,8

33270,A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,Spike,Okay. I hid the artifacts for the Spell-venger Hunt and ordered school supplies for the week. All you have to worry about is teaching class.,joy,8

33336,A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,Starlight Glimmer,[nervous laughter] Don't worry. I just banished him from school grounds forever. He's fine.,surprise,8
33337,A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,Spike,That probably made things worse. Why didn't you just talk to Discord?,neutral,8
33338,A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,Starlight Glimmer,Because he's right about one thing. I've been doing a terrible job as headmare.,sadness,8

33340,A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,Starlight Glimmer,Maybe. But I wonder why me being in charge bothers him so much.,neutral,8
33341,A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,Spike,We can figure that out after the Spell-venger Hunt. C'mon!,joy,8
33342,A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,Starlight Glimmer,"For this afternoon's Spell-venger Hunt, you'll need to use the artifacts' history to find where they're hidden in the castle. When you spot one, touch it with a magic shield to keep track of your score.",joy,8
33343,A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,Spike,Twilight left the list of your hunt partners before she left. I'll pass out the shields.,neutral,8
33344,A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,Starlight Glimmer,Ready... set... Spell-venger Hunt!,joy,8

33365,A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,Spike,I thought you banished him from the school.,surprise,8

33391,A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,Starlight Glimmer,"Nopony ever invited you to the school. And when you offered to help, I didn't listen. I was so worried about doing things Twilight's way, I didn't stop to think about being a good friend. I'd like to apologize for that. And offer you the job of vice headmare.",joy,8
33392,A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,Spike,Huh?,surprise,8
33399,A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,Discord,"I accept! I mean, I-I-I suppose I can find some time in my busy schedule to help you out. But I will need my own office, expense account, parking space...",joy,8

33401,A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,Starlight Glimmer,"Next time you want something, just ask for it, all right?",anger,8
33402,A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,Discord,But then we'd miss out on all those delightful misadventures.,joy,8

33821,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Starlight Glimmer,"Uh, look. It may seem like Rarity and Rainbow Dash don't have that much in common when you try to put it into words, but sometimes friendships can't be explained. You just have to see them in action to understand.",joy,8

33869,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Starlight Glimmer,"You both love books. Rainbow Dash never stops talking about Daring Do adventures, and you're a huge fan of Shadow Spade mysteries.",joy,8
33870,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,Your point?,anger,8
33871,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Starlight Glimmer,"The perfect way for you two to reconnect as friends is to read each other's favorite book. I'll read them, too. Then we'll all discuss afterward. It'll be a ""Good Friends Book Club"". Okay? I'll bring snacks.",joy,8
33872,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rainbow Dash,Ugh! Fine!,anger,8
33873,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,If you insist.,neutral,8
33874,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Starlight Glimmer,"Great! We're all here! To start, why don't you two share one thing you liked about each other's books?",joy,8
33875,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Starlight Glimmer,"Okay. I'll go first. Uh, I really enjoy the part in Daring Do and the Razor of Dreams when Daring used a vicious cragadile as a raft, and then<U+0097>",joy,8

33879,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rainbow Dash,But they're real! You even met Daring Do!,joy,8
33880,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,"Yes, but the book's descriptions just drag on, and what about those silly unpronounceable names? Doctor whozit-whatsit... [Spanish pronunciation] Caballeron?",disgust,8
33881,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Starlight Glimmer,"Uh, tea, anypony? Cucumber sandwich? [laughs nervously] Or we could go over some nice friendly talking points.",joy,8
33882,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rainbow Dash,[scoffs] Seriously?! Don't even get me started on those clothing descriptions in Shadow Spade! What a yawn fest!,disgust,8
33883,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,[stutters] But... the outfit descriptions are an integral part of the plot of The Colt in Crimson: A Shadow Spade Mystery!,surprise,8
33884,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,"You see, if you didn't know that Sir Fluffingsworth von Radishfield wears only silk, double-breasted waistcoats, you'd never deduce that he, in fact, was the culprit!",surprise,8
33885,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rainbow Dash,W-Wait. He was?,surprise,8
33886,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,[gasps] You didn't even read it!,surprise,8

33888,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rainbow Dash,Not my fault it's so boring and put me to sleep!,anger,8
33889,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,"If you can't be bothered to read the thing I like, that just further illustrates the point that we have nothing in common anymore!",anger,8
33890,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rainbow Dash,"At least we agree on that! From now on, I'm only hanging out with ponies who get me!",joy,8

33901,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Starlight Glimmer,While we work on a locator spell. It's the perfect solution!,joy,8

33903,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rainbow Dash,"Rarity, your boots are leaving sparkles all over the floor!",joy,8
33904,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,"Pfft! Those aren't from my boots. Mine are magenta, not blue. See?",surprise,8
33905,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,"I mean, really!",anger,8
33906,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,"[panting] Turns out these boots were not ""made for trotting,"" as advertised. Where are you going?! We promised Twilight we'd work together!",fear,8
33907,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rainbow Dash,Don't you see? The Amulet of Aurora is made out of Azurantium!,surprise,8
33908,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rainbow Dash,"Azurantium? You know! The same metal that the Amulet of Atonement from Daring Do book four is made from? It always leaves sparkles wherever it goes. Just like this, remember? It's from the book you just read!",joy,8
33909,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,[laughs nervously] That book! Yes! The one I-I just... just read! Ha-ha-ha!,surprise,8

33913,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,Fine by me!,joy,8
33914,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,"[panting] Ooh! Rainbow Dash, slow down! You're flying past important clues! Look, it's a print. But definitely not a hoof. Are those claw marks?",surprise,8
33915,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rainbow Dash,Who cares? I found a bigger clue!,joy,8
33916,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,I hope you don't expect me to... [shudders] ...wade through that.,disgust,8
33917,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rainbow Dash,Nah. It's too deep. We'll get stuck.,fear,8
33918,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,Ooh. Clever. What Daring Do book did you get that from?,joy,8
33919,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rainbow Dash,"Actually, I learned it at Scootaloo's Filly Guides camp.",joy,8

33921,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rainbow Dash,"[gasps, grunts] Nope. If one of those geysers burns off my wing feathers, I'll be out of the Wonderbolts for weeks. [groans] I could...",fear,8
33922,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rainbow Dash,"...try and slingshot my way through. But I'd need two perfectly placed trees, some stretchy rope, and a pith helmet. [groans] Too bad we can't do what Daring Do did in book four and find a cragadile for a raft.",joy,8

33924,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rainbow Dash,"Uh, that... is... awesome! Uh, I mean, it's all right, I guess.",joy,8
33925,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rainbow Dash,How did you know how to do that?,surprise,8
33926,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,"Mmm. We may have been friends for a super-long time, but you don't know everything about me yet.",joy,8
33927,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,[gasps] The glitter trail! It's gone!,surprise,8

33930,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,[loudly] Sorry! What did you say?!,anger,8
33932,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rainbow Dash,I think it's a Bufogren. They have really sensitive ears. [whispering loudly] Did you happen to see anycreature with a sparkly thingy go this way?,surprise,8
33934,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rainbow Dash,"His breath smells so bad, I can't think! But we can't hear him from back here. Now what?",disgust,8
33935,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,"Hmmm... [sniffs] Aha! I think I have the perfect solution. An old unicorn beauty trick. That is, if you can somehow procure us a tiny bit of cloud?",joy,8

33946,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,[exhales] Thank you.,joy,8
33947,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rainbow Dash,Huh. Maybe the key to unlocking this thing is in these inscriptions.,surprise,8
33948,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,Or perhaps the key is right here!,surprise,8
33949,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,"I couldn't decide between the boots and the stilettos, so I got both!",joy,8
33950,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rainbow Dash,High heels could do that?,surprise,8
33951,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,"And you called them ""useless"".",anger,8
33952,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rainbow Dash,[sighs] I shouldn't have said that. Or made fun of the other stuff you like to do. Some of it's actually sorta neat.,sadness,8
33953,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,"I... owe you an apology, too. Buckball may not be my thing, but it's something you enjoy. And you're very good at it. I never should've treated your interests like they were worth less than mine.",joy,8
33954,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rainbow Dash,Soooo... does this mean we're still friends?,neutral,8
33955,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,I would very much like that. Now let's go find that amulet!,joy,8

33961,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rainbow Dash,...reeeeeally needed it.,joy,8
33963,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rarity,Heh. Always. I think we just needed a teensy reminder.,joy,8
33964,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rainbow Dash,"Yeah. We don't have to love the exact same things to have fun together. I mean, imagine if we did! How boring would that be?",joy,8

33966,The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,Rainbow Dash,We still have a little time left. You wanna... go hit the shops? I could actually use your help picking out some new buckball gear.,joy,8

33972,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Fluttershy,Ooh! It sounds like a herd of injured chimerae! [pants] Or it's Cerberus with snifflitis in two of its heads and kennel cough in its third. Or maybe it's<U+0097>,surprise,8
33973,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Fluttershy,Pinkie Pie?,joy,8

33978,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Rainbow Dash,Is it supposed to sound like that?,surprise,8
33979,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Twilight Sparkle,"Not exactly. It's known to produce a fairly complicated, melodically rich, and harmonious tone.",neutral,8
33980,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Rainbow Dash,Are you sure we're talking about the same thing?,neutral,8
33981,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Pinkie Pie,[panting] Phew! And that's with only a few days of practice! Can you believe it?!,joy,8
33982,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Rarity,"Yes. Yes, I can.",joy,8
33983,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Applejack,I can honestly say I've never heard anything like it in my life.,surprise,8

33994,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, so maybe she isn't good yet. But she's our friend, and we should be supportive.",joy,8

34010,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Applejack,"Oh, no, no, no! We're not goin' through that again! Remember how well it worked out when you weren't honest with Celestia about her actin' ability?",anger,8
34011,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Twilight Sparkle,[groans] You're right. We'll just have to tell Pinkie Pie she's not very good at the yovidaphone.,sadness,8

34019,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Pinkie Pie,"Yeah, she was awful! But that's kind of a random thing to bring up. I thought you wanted to talk about my yovidaphone playing.",neutral,8
34020,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Rainbow Dash,"Well, it's, uh... It's just... You need to know, uh... Twilight?",neutral,8
34021,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Twilight Sparkle,"[sighs] Pinkie, we all support you, but we're afraid you're just not good at the yovidaphone, and none of us want you to waste your time on something you can't do well.",fear,8

34023,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Rainbow Dash,[sighs] We were all really nervous to tell you.,fear,8
34024,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Pinkie Pie,"Why? It's just a silly instrument. Well, lunch break's over. Gotta get back to the bakery. Those apple turnovers aren't gonna apple themselves! [whistles gleefully] No more yovidaphone playing for me-e-e!",joy,8
34025,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Fluttershy,Wow. She took that so much better than I thought.,surprise,8
34026,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Twilight Sparkle,[sighs] Another beautiful day in Ponyville.,joy,8

34029,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Spike,I don't think she took it as well as you think she took it.,neutral,8
34031,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Pinkie Pie,Is it morning? I hadn't noticed.,neutral,8
34032,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Twilight Sparkle,That's not good.,sadness,8
34033,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Rainbow Dash,There you are! We've been looking all over for you!,joy,8
34034,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Rarity,It turns out Pinkie may not have taken our critique of her yovidaphone playing in the spirit with which it was intended.,sadness,8
34035,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Twilight Sparkle,I saw.,neutral,8
34037,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Twilight Sparkle,"I'm sure there is, Spike. We just have to figure out what.",neutral,8
34038,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Rainbow Dash,[sighs] I don't get it. So she's no good at playing the yovidaphone. What's the big deal? There are so many other things she's really good at doing.,sadness,8
34039,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Applejack,Yeah! Not bein' able to play the yovidaphone is nothin' compared to all the things she can do well.,joy,8
34040,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Twilight Sparkle,"And that's exactly what we'll show her! I bet if we get her to do the stuff she likes and is good at doing, she'll cheer right back up and forget all about the yovidaphone.",joy,8
34041,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Applejack,Hoo-whee! That's a great idea!,joy,8
34042,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Rarity,"Let's get started. Apparently, there's not a moment to lose.",joy,8
34043,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Twilight Sparkle,"So, I'm guessing nopony had any success?",neutral,8
34044,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Applejack,[sighs] My party cannon idea was a real dud.,sadness,8
34045,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Rainbow Dash,Don't blame yourself. None of us did any better.,neutral,8
34046,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Twilight Sparkle,"Well, not to worry. I came up with the perfect solution. Instead of trying to remind her what she's good at, we'll remind her what she's best at. And that's being our friend. We're gonna throw her a Pinkie Pie Appreciation Party!",joy,8

34122,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Pinkie Pie,[despondent] That's what's wrong. I thought coming here and listening to real yovidaphone playing would make me happy.,sadness,8
34123,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Pinkie Pie,[despondent] It makes me feel worse. I'm never gonna sound like that.,sadness,8

34140,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Fluttershy,Playing makes you happy.,joy,8

34142,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Applejack,So get up there and show these yaks how it's done!,joy,8
34143,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Pinkie Pie,"[stage whisper] I don't know if you've noticed, but the audience are all yaks, and they kind of have ""issues"" with things that aren't perfect! Like my playing!",surprise,8
34144,Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,Rainbow Dash,"Pinkie Pie, you get up on that stage and play. If these yaks don't like it, they'll have to answer to us!",joy,8

34167,Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,It was pretty fun.,joy,8
34168,Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,Of course it was! There's nothing better than a bond with another pony. You can share all kinds of things.,joy,8
34169,Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,I think we'll stick to the stage magic for now.,neutral,8
34172,Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,Doing a show with you is almost as much fun as counseling students at Twilight's school! [gasps] Which I'm supposed to be doing right now!,joy,8

34186,Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,Hmmm. Sounds like your mind's made up.,neutral,8
34188,Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,Really?,surprise,8
34190,Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,Nothing! This will be the best magical road trip ever!,joy,8
34191,Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,I should probably get somepony to cover my student counseling duties while we're gone.,neutral,8
34192,Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,"Trixie, are you all right?",neutral,8
34194,Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,"You bet I did! Everything two ponies need for the road trip of their lives! Three one-thousand-piece puzzles, one copy of Dragon Pit <U+0096> the best board game in the history of ponies <U+0096> my famous collection of campfire spices, and an inflatable raft. Did I forget something? I could pop back to the castle and grab it.",joy,8

34203,Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,I'm sure.,neutral,8
34205,Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,"Trixie, there's plenty of high-quality inns to stay at on the way. Don't worry about it. I'm not backing out of the greatest and most powerful road trip bonding experience two ponies could ever have.",joy,8
34207,Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,"Me, too! [sighs] Thank goodness we're not like Twilight or the others. They'd probably sing a song about it.",joy,8

34212,Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,"I'm glad we're sticking to it, we've already got a song",joy,8

34238,Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,[sighs] Sorry about wasting bits on street food.,sadness,8
34240,Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,"Um, why don't we go there?",neutral,8

34244,Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,And I'm sure we'll find out that waiting in that super-long line was worth it.,joy,8
34247,Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,"Uh, I'm sure we'll find something.",neutral,8
34253,Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,"Um, I've been with you singing and standing in line. When would I have done that?",surprise,8
34255,Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,So you just brought me along to do your legwork?,anger,8
34257,Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,"[sighs] Me, too. But since there's literally no room at the inns, I guess it's lucky we've got the wagon.",neutral,8
34258,Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,[unenthusiastically] Sleeping-in-tight-quarters bonding.,neutral,8
34261,Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,You could get rid of this junk.,anger,8

34284,Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,[flatly] She's been in there a long time. Do you suppose the Terrifying Trunk Escape is too much for a pony who drinks all the juice and talks non-stop in her sleep?! What if the Great and Powerful Trixie can't...,surprise,8
34286,Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,"[flatly] But if you're there, who's in here?",surprise,8
34291,Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,"Oh, no. It might make me thirsty, and we don't have anything to drink. So...",fear,8
34293,Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,"Well, I'm looking forward to rehearsing the act with you all night. So diligent of you to go over it and over it in your sleep.",joy,8

34300,Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,[derisive laugh] Ya think?!,surprise,8
34302,Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,I traded it to that pony from Saddle Arabia for his. He even threw in a pair of robes.,joy,8

34348,Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,Starlight Glimmer,That's fair.,neutral,8

34364,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Scootaloo,You eavesdrop on every meeting? That's weird.,disgust,8
34365,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Rainbow Dash,"Well, sure it sounds weird when you say it out loud. And I probably shouldn't because eavesdropping is wrong, but still. Why are you starting a new fan club?",surprise,8
34366,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Scootaloo,I just think maybe it's time for me to explore other fan clubs.,neutral,8

34373,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Scootaloo,Are you just repeating everything I say?,anger,8

34376,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Rainbow Dash,Can you believe she actually said that?!,surprise,8
34377,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Pinkie Pie,"Pfft, well, yeah! Eavesdropping on every meeting is kinda weird.",disgust,8
34378,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Rainbow Dash,"I mean, she basically said that the Wonderbolts aren't cool! And... And it kinda sounded like she didn't think I was cool either. But, peh, we all know that's crazy! I mean, I'm definitely not worried about her looking up to somepony else. Heh. Nope. Not! At! All!",sadness,8

34405,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Scootaloo,I can't just go up and talk to them.,fear,8
34406,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Rainbow Dash,"You can if you're with me. After all, one of the reasons there's a Rainbow Dash fan club is because I'm fearless. Observe.",joy,8

34438,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Rainbow Dash,"Well, we do have safety rules for a reason.",neutral,8
34440,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Rainbow Dash,It's not about making anypony feel bad. It's about finding the best flyers. The best of the best.,neutral,8

34470,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Scootaloo,"More like ""follow your wingflaps"".",surprise,8
34471,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Rainbow Dash,Same difference.,neutral,8
34472,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Scootaloo,"[sarcastically] Thanks, super-talented flyer, for clearing up what I should do.",anger,8
34473,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Rainbow Dash,"Clearing things up is one of my specialties. Now, come on. Let's go rip up all your Washout posters into tiny pieces and throw 'em off a cliff.",joy,8
34474,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Rainbow Dash,"I just thought of a great way to raise awareness for your original fan club. You know, the one about me?",joy,8
34475,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Rainbow Dash,How about a silent auction where every item is just a picture of yours truly? [laughs] Nah! I'm just kidding.,joy,8
34476,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Rainbow Dash,"That makes me seem too egotistical, doesn't it? Oh, oh! Maybe if they're framed, it's like, ""Wow, she's so humble!"" Ya think? Scootaloo?",surprise,8

34483,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Rainbow Dash,"Seriously?! [groans] You haven't seen Scoot, have you?",anger,8
34484,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Twilight Sparkle,Actually...,neutral,8
34485,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Rainbow Dash,I can't believe Scootaloo ditched me to watch them practice! Why can't she see how dangerous they are?!,anger,8
34486,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Twilight Sparkle,That's kind of the whole draw. It's exciting.,joy,8
34488,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Twilight Sparkle,"You can't control her actions. Only yours. Teach her what's safe and what isn't, like a good role model. Then hope she makes the right decisions.",neutral,8
34489,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Rainbow Dash,But what if she chooses them over me? She's gonna get hurt!,fear,8
34490,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Twilight Sparkle,I think I know somepony else who might get hurt if that happens.,fear,8
34491,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Rainbow Dash,"Um, maybe you're right. But this isn't about me. I'm just worried about Scoot.",fear,8
34495,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Rainbow Dash,"You haven't seen Scootaloo, have you?",neutral,8
34497,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Rainbow Dash,[growls] I'd appreciate you helping me find her so I could apologize for trying to make her quit liking you.,anger,8

34500,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Scootaloo,I don't need you standing up for me!,anger,8
34501,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Rainbow Dash,"Obviously, you do! Because you can't see how dangerous this is! Do you not remember what Spitfire said?",anger,8
34503,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Rainbow Dash,That doesn't even sound like Spitfire.,anger,8
34504,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Rainbow Dash,That's it! We're leaving!,anger,8
34505,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Scootaloo,"Just because I look up to you doesn't mean I have to be you! But based on your definition of what makes somepony great, I have bad news. I'll never be the best of the best or a Wonderbolt! Because I! Can't! Fly! Is that what you wanted to hear? But not being able to fly doesn't mean I can't do something awesome! Like strapping my scooter to a multi-stage liquid-fueled rocket and jumping twenty-two wagons lined up in front of a roaring crowd!",anger,8
34506,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Twilight Sparkle,That was awfully specific.,surprise,8
34508,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Twilight Sparkle,"Scootaloo, are you sure that's what you really wanna do?",neutral,8
34509,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Scootaloo,Absolutely. [to Rainbow] And there's nothing you can do to stop me!,anger,8

34511,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Scootaloo,Good! Because I already have!,joy,8
34512,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Applejack,Hoo-wee! Looks like all of Ponyville is here. Except for Rainbow Dash.,joy,8
34516,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Scootaloo,"Lightning Dust, I have to tell you. I actually started Equestria's first Washouts fan club! As far as I know. So this is a real honor, ma'am! Uh, do I call you ""ma'am""?",joy,8
34518,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Scootaloo,Wow. That sure is...,surprise,8
34520,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Scootaloo,Has anypony tested it before?,neutral,8

34536,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Rainbow Dash,Wouldn't have it any other way!,joy,8
34537,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Scootaloo,"I'm sorry for joining the Washouts. Lightning Dust wasn't who I thought she was. She didn't care about me being scared or putting me in danger. She only wanted a good show, even if it meant I got hurt. That's not the kind of pony I wanna look up to.",sadness,8
34538,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Rainbow Dash,I'm the one who should be apologizing for not acting like somepony who deserves a fan club. I've been lucky enough to have somepony who thinks I'm the coolest. But there's nothing cool about making you feel like you'll never be as awesome as me. I think we should cancel the Washouts Fan Club. Because I know a fan club that could use some new members.,sadness,8
34539,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Scootaloo,The Rainbow Dash Fan Club!,joy,8
34540,The Washouts,Nick Confalone,Rainbow Dash,"[clears throat] Welcome to the first ever meeting of the newest fan club for the awesomest, previously under-appreciated pony in Ponyville! With founding member and president Rainbow Dash presiding, it's the... Scootaloo Fan Club!",joy,8

34578,A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,Twilight Sparkle,"From what Professor Fossil said, it sounds like Rockhoof just hasn't settled into modern times yet. Our school is the perfect place for that. Plus, we get a new teacher.",joy,8

34582,A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,Applejack,Maybe classrooms were less breakable in the old days?,neutral,8

34606,A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,Pinkie Pie,I'm not sure. But I think it's surf's up! Woo-hoo! Cowabunga!,joy,8

34614,A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,Rarity,One who doesn't ruin an entire class's friendship quilts. Do you know how hard it is to stitch a pineapple pattern?!,anger,8
34616,A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,Pinkie Pie,Wheeeee!,joy,8
34617,A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,Twilight Sparkle,"So apparently, finding Rockhoof a new job is a lot harder than we thought. Has anypony had any luck?",neutral,8

34622,A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,Rarity,Yup. Rockhoof's time as a spa masseuse didn't work out either.,sadness,8
34624,A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,Rainbow Dash,"W-Well, at least Rockhoof's really strong. Maybe we could find him a job carrying heavy stuff?",joy,8
34625,A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,Pinkie Pie,"I tried that already. Zecora needed somepony to help her get supplies, but...",sadness,8

34920,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,"Aw, it's just a name. It doesn't mean anythin'.",joy,8

34922,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,"Fair point. So, what can ya tell us about the place, Twilight?",neutral,8
34923,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Twilight Sparkle,"Only what Rockhoof told me. Back in his day, nopony knew much about the Peaks of Peril except for the legend on this ancient shield. It says a group called the Kirin used to live there, known for their kindness and truth-speaking.",joy,8
34924,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,Now we know why the Map called us.,surprise,8
34925,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Twilight Sparkle,"Unfortunately, other creatures also lived there. The Nirik, fearsome beasts of pure fire.",fear,8

34943,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Fluttershy,Applejack! Can you please listen to me?! [clears throat] What I'm trying to say is the squirrels told me a shortcut they take to the Kirin village.,joy,8
34944,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,"Oh. [chuckles] Sorry, Fluttershy. I suppose I got a little too caught up in the adventure.",joy,8
34945,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Fluttershy,"That's all right. If you hadn't come back to get me, I probably would've talked to the squirrels all day. Heh.",joy,8
34946,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,Show yourself!,fear,8
34947,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,"Well, hi. I'm Applejack, and this here's Fluttershy.",joy,8

34957,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,Like talkin' to Angel Bunny?,joy,8
34958,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Fluttershy,Not exactly. I can always tell what Angel is feeling. But these Kirin don't show anything.,neutral,8
34960,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,"These Kirin are quieter than an apple blossom on snowfall. Still, there's gotta be some way to make 'em speak. [chuckles] Beautiful day, ain't it?",joy,8

34967,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Fluttershy,A dark spooky path that leads into unknown territory?,fear,8
34968,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,"Tell you what, sugarcube. You stay and see if you can get anythin' outta these here Kirin. I'll go and try to find one that talks.",joy,8
34969,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Fluttershy,Phew! Be careful. And watch out for Niriks!,fear,8
34970,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,[yelps] Phew! [yelps] Oh. Have you seen a Kirin that talks?,surprise,8
34971,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,Any idea where I should look?,neutral,8

34983,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,[sighs] You'd rather not talk about it?,sadness,8
34985,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,I-I under<U+0097>,neutral,8
35008,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,[gasps] I can't believe it! Nopony should give up feelin'... their feelin's just to keep from gettin' angry!,surprise,8

35012,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,"Right... Well, I'm thinkin' if we just go talk to the other Kirin, we can get 'em to welcome you back proper-like. Maybe even convince 'em to take your cure.",joy,8
35014,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,There's no cure left?!,fear,8
35016,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,"[sighs] Well, this wouldn't be a friendship quest if it was easy. I'm gonna start by gettin' your friends to welcome you back!",joy,8
35018,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,[panting] Fluttershy! Guess what!,joy,8
35019,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,Bet that's a problem the Kirin never have.,neutral,8
35020,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Fluttershy,[giggles] No.,joy,8

35023,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,I thought you said you figured out the friendship problem. Was somethin' lost in translation?,anger,8
35024,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Fluttershy,"The Kirin are usually peaceful and kind. But when they get mad, they turn into Niriks, creatures made of fire and vengeance!",fear,8
35025,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,Heh. That seemed less scary when it was in a song.,fear,8
35026,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Fluttershy,"The last time they all argued, they got so angry, they accidentally destroyed their whole village. So the Kirin decided to make sure it would never happen again.",anger,8
35027,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,But that's no reason to stop talkin'.,joy,8
35028,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Fluttershy,"Yes, it is! Fire is dangerous, especially in a forest like this. Why, think of all the animals it could hurt.",fear,8
35029,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,Not if they don't turn into fire-breathin' Nirik in the first place.,anger,8
35030,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Fluttershy,And how can you be sure that won't happen?,fear,8
35031,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,There's gotta be a better way than givin' up all your feelin's!,sadness,8
35032,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Fluttershy,Applejack! You're not listening!,anger,8
35033,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,'Cause you're not talkin' any sense!,anger,8
35034,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Fluttershy,"Um, what are they doing?",surprise,8
35035,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Fluttershy,[grunts] Maybe they got worried because we were arguing with each other.,fear,8
35036,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,"Aw, shucks! We were just havin' a normal, civil disagreement! Honest!",joy,8
35037,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,"To the Stream of Silence! If we hit that water, we'll never be able to talk or feel anythin' ever again!",fear,8
35039,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,It's all right. I think I know this one. And she's tryin' to help.,joy,8
35041,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Fluttershy,She talks?,surprise,8
35042,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,"You have no idea. Fluttershy, meet Autumn Blaze.",surprise,8
35043,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Fluttershy,"Well, thank you for that... um, wall of fire. But I thought Niriks were dangerous when they're angry. How did you know you could control your temper?",surprise,8
35045,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,And givin' up happiness to keep away anger is no kind o' life.,sadness,8
35046,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Fluttershy,I never thought of it that way. I can't imagine not being able to talk to my animal friends.,joy,8
35048,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,I know you're worried about fightin'. But friends can disagree without causin' a ruckus.,neutral,8
35049,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Fluttershy,Everypony gets mad sometimes. Even Applejack and I argue.,anger,8
35050,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,What?! When do we ever argue?,surprise,8
35051,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Fluttershy,[clears throat] On the way here? And about the Kirin being silent? And right now!,surprise,8
35052,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,We don't always see eye-to-eye. But we never let that get in the way of our friendship.,joy,8
35053,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Fluttershy,"And if you're really angry, then take some time away to be a Nirik where it won't hurt anypony.",anger,8
35054,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,I-I think they're tryin' to say somethin'.,fear,8
35057,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Fluttershy,"That's wonderful! Uh, isn't it?",joy,8
35058,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,"Well, it would be. Except there aren't any flowers left to make the cure.",sadness,8
35059,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Fluttershy,Are you sure?,neutral,8
35061,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Fluttershy,Hmm. I wish she'd told us what kind of flowers she's looking for.,neutral,8
35062,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,They're called foal's-breath.,joy,8
35063,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Fluttershy,I've never heard of that.,neutral,8
35064,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,"Uh, Fluttershy? A little help?",neutral,8
35065,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Fluttershy,[gasps] He says he knows where to find more foal's-breath!,surprise,8
35066,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,"Well, what are we waitin' for? Lead the way!",joy,8
35067,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Fluttershy,[gasps] That's what foal's-breath looks like?!,surprise,8
35068,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,Autumn Blaze never would've made it past the Peaks to search here. I owe you an apology.,joy,8
35069,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Fluttershy,Why?,neutral,8
35070,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,"'Cause if your kindness hadn't made you stop to help the squirrels, we never would've found this here flower.",joy,8
35071,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Fluttershy,"And if your honesty hadn't convinced the Kirin to talk, we wouldn't need to find it.",neutral,8
35072,Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,Applejack,"[chuckles] Guess it's a good thing the map sent both of us, huh?",joy,8
35079,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,Woo-hoo-hoo!,joy,8
35080,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,Whoa! Ta-da!,surprise,8
35081,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, Spike. Now let's try a flip. Remember <U+0096> two flaps, then straight up!",joy,8
35082,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,Got it!,joy,8
35083,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"You're doing great, Spike. Now let's see the big finish!",joy,8
35084,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,Whoa-oa-oa-oa!,surprise,8
35085,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,"[grunts] I don't know about ""big"", but I am definitely finished.",anger,8
35086,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,Maybe I should get Rainbow Dash. She's the one who taught me advanced flying techniques.,joy,8
35087,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,"No, thanks. If I'm gonna mess up, I'd rather do it in front of you. I just don't understand why none of your advice is helping.",sadness,8
35089,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,What's the difference?,neutral,8
35091,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,Ye-he-he-hes!,joy,8
35092,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,Wow! Thank you so much! How did you know I just needed to bend my wings?,joy,8
35094,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, I've been thinking about our flying lesson.",joy,8
35095,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,Uh-huh...,neutral,8
35096,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"I can't believe I overlooked something as simple as feathers. It's no wonder you were having trouble. I wish I had more ""dragonish"" knowledge to give you. Do you think being raised by ponies has affected you in other ways? Spike?",sadness,8
35097,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,"Did you say something, Twilight? Sorry. I'm just finishing up this ""thank-you"" throw pillow for Smolder. And you know how I get when I'm in the embroidery zone.",joy,8
35098,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,It's a pillow! But not for your head. Although it could be. It's a throw pillow. They're more casual. You can use 'em anywhere. You don't like it.,neutral,8
35100,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,What?,surprise,8
35102,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,I don't know. But it's... heading right for us!,fear,8
35103,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,Okay. Now I really owe you for the lesson.,joy,8
35104,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,You all right?,neutral,8
35108,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,Maybe not. But you're hurt and need help. So I'm taking you to Twilight's castle whether you like it or not?,fear,8
35109,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"I'm glad Spike brought you here, Sludge. I understand you made quite the impression in town.",joy,8
35110,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Pinkie Pie,Literally! There's a hole and everything!,surprise,8
35111,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Applejack,It doesn't look like you're in much shape to do anything.,sadness,8
35112,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Rarity,"Darling, do be careful.",fear,8
35114,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Fluttershy,I can't watch!,fear,8
35115,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Rainbow Dash,"You're not the first stubborn dragon we've met, you know?",neutral,8
35116,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,"And sometimes, even dragons need help.",joy,8
35117,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,I promise. My friends and I will only do enough to get you back on your claws.,neutral,8
35118,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"I know you had your reservations, but it's good to see you feeling better.",joy,8
35120,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Rarity,"That's what friends are for, darling.",joy,8
35122,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,"Actually, I was orphaned as an egg, and Twilight raised me. So these ponies are more than my friends. They're my family.",joy,8
35123,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"We try our best, but sometimes I worry that maybe Spike is...",fear,8
35124,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,Missing something deep down and dragonish.,sadness,8
35126,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Applejack,Why in Equestria would you be glad to hear that?,surprise,8
35128,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Pinkie Pie,[continues gasping] Sorry.,fear,8
35129,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,So you crashed in Ponyville on purpose?,surprise,8
35131,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,Did you ask in the Crystal Empire? I'm kind of well-known there.,neutral,8
35132,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Pinkie Pie,"Actually, Spike's well-known everywhere. Not a lot of dragons were hatched by the Princess of Friendship.",joy,8
35133,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Applejack,Mm-hmm.,neutral,8
35135,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,I can't believe it. I have so many questions.,surprise,8
35137,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,I guess my biggest question is simple. Why was I an orphaned egg?,sadness,8
35140,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Pinkie Pie,Ooh! Did you visit Klugetown?,surprise,8
35142,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"Also, the Hippogriffs returned to Mount Aris after we helped them defeat the Storm King.",joy,8

35152,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Pinkie Pie,Hmm?,surprise,8
35153,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,"Well, that's all in the past. The only thing that matters now is that we're together. And I'm gonna make up for lost time.",joy,8
35154,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,"I hope you don't mind, but I have a list of all the things I always wanted to do with my dad?",joy,8
35156,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,"Well, I've kind of been working on a list for a long time.",neutral,8

35162,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,I can't believe we got so many things done. But this is all my stuff. Is there anything you always wanted to do with me?,joy,8
35165,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,Like a real dragon?,surprise,8
35167,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,Huh?,surprise,8
35168,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"Hey, Spike! How are things going with Sludge?",joy,8
35169,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,"Honestly, I thought having him around would make me feel more dragonish. But I kind of feel less.",disgust,8
35170,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, I'm sorry. I wish I could help.",joy,8
35172,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"Maybe you two can come up with ways to turn up Spike's, uh, dragonishness.",joy,8

35196,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,You got it! I'm gonna go get you all the cushy pony stuff I've got... Dad.,joy,8
35198,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,Spike? I just thought I'd check to see if you and Sludge had any luck turning up your dragonishness. It's hard not to feel like somehow I let you down all these years.,sadness,8
35199,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,Oh! I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to barge in on ya!,surprise,8
35201,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"Right. Well, I'll just get out of your way.",neutral,8
35202,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,Oh! Spike! I'm so sorry. My morning is not going well. What is all this? Why'd you leave the castle so early?,surprise,8
35203,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,I didn't leave. I spent the night outdoors to get in touch with my dragon side.,joy,8
35204,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,Outdoors?,neutral,8
35205,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,Yeah! And Sludge asked me to bring him the best breakfast Ponyville has to offer so he can show me how a real dragon would eat it. See you later!,joy,8

35210,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Rarity,I'm not sure that's exactly the word I would use.,neutral,8
35212,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,Be right there... Dad.,joy,8
35213,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,I'm glad you're not spending the night outside again.,joy,8

35216,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,What do you mean?,neutral,8
35217,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"Well, taking over your room, making a mess of things...",anger,8
35218,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,[scoffs] That is dragon culture.,disgust,8
35219,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,You never acted like that.,surprise,8
35220,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,That's because you raised me. Now I finally have a chance to see how I'm supposed to be.,joy,8
35221,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,I don't think you're supposed to be any different than who you are.,neutral,8
35222,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,Maybe you just don't like that I have a real parent now.,sadness,8

35226,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,Just sleeping outside like we're meant to. It's not like dragons are supposed to live in castles.,joy,8
35228,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,"[sighs] I'm so confused. It's been great having Sludge show me how to be a real dragon, but Twilight just doesn't get it.",sadness,8
35232,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,"Well, not now, of course. I'm too busy bringing him pony stuff so he can show me what a dragon would do with it.",joy,8
35234,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,Huh. Now I'm really confused.,surprise,8
35237,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,"Twilight doesn't like having real dragons in the castle, so I told her we're moving out.",anger,8

35262,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Spike,"I'm the one who's sorry. You were just worried about me, and I lost my temper. Sludge was just a great big phony.",sadness,8
35263,Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,Twilight Sparkle,"I have to say, I'm not surprised. There's no way a dragon like that was related to you. But if you still want to search for your real family, I'd understand if you spent more time in the Dragon Lands.",sadness,8

35386,School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,Twilight Sparkle,"This is the only door to Tartarus. The good news is the seal isn't broken, so we know Tirek didn't escape.",fear,8

35388,School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,Twilight Sparkle,"Last time I was here, I had to use magic to get in. And according to Star Swirl, all unicorn magic was gone by yesterday's sunset.",fear,8

35476,School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,Pinkie Pie,"Maybe there's a way to get out without magic. Like a secret lever or a secret button or a secret admirer who knows a secret about you but is all, ""Your secret's safe with me because I put it in Tartarus and I have a key!""",surprise,8
